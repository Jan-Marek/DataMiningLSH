# DataMiningLSH
Finding similar or near-duplicate documents using LSH
**Deadline:** 21.12.2018


## Plan:
1) Find top matches for each document using TF-IDF
    - [x] Refactor TF-IDF algorithm
    - [x] Find efficient way of running this for all documents
    - [ ] Find top 50 matches
2) Implement LSH (probably minhash) 
    - [ ] Find top 50 matches using LSH
    - [ ] Experiment with LSH configurations to approach accuraccy of TF-IDF
    - [ ] Compare speed/accuraccy
    - [ ] Define writing LSH MinHash Class
    - [ ] Try MinHash LSH on small dataset
    - [ ] Define Plot function of benchmark
    - [ ] Try all the documents
    - [ ] Try different parameters
    - [ ] Plot
3) Report results

## Notes:
 - do first experiments using subset of documents
