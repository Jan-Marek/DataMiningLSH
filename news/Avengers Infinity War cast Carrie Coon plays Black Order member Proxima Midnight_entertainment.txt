Avengers: Infinity War may be just around the corner, but one cast member has only just been announced.
Carrie Coon – best known for roles in the third season of Fargo and HBO’s The Leftovers – will play Proxima Midnight, a member of Thanos’s villainous Black Order.
Speaking to RadioTimes, the Russo Brothers revealed the news, while also confirming Tom Vaughan-Lawlor will play fellow Black Order member Ebony Maw.
Proxima Midnight is the only female member of the evil team who act as Thanos’s henchmen, helping the Titan acquire the Infinity Stones.

Terry Notary, who recently appeared in The Square and has played multiple motion capture characters, will voice fellow member Cull Obsidian. The voice actor behind the last Black Order member Corvus Glaive remains unknown.
Along with being nominated for a prime-time Emmy, Coon recently appeared in Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-nominated The Post. The actor will also appear in Josh Hill’s The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter, where she stars opposite Thanos actor Josh Brolin.
Infinity War, which marks the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movies, has already set records — the first full trailer quickly became the most-watched trailer within 24 hours ever.
