The IPO of the Netflix-like video platform priced on Wednesday in the middle of its $17-$19 per share estimate, generating proceeds of $2.25 billion.
Chief Executive Gong Yu shrugged off any concerns over fluctuations in the stock price.
“We are not concerned with short-term volatility,” Gong said in an interview at the Nasdaq. “Long term, you’ll see how much value the IPO creates.”
