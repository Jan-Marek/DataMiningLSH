Britain's Naomi Broady aced her way into the second round at Monterrey, while Heather Watson failed to progress in Charleston.
With no fewer than 21 aces Broady saw off a spirited challenge by Canada's Carol Zhao 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-2 to set up a second round clash with Hungarian number four seed Timea Babos.
Other players to progress in Mexico were top-seeded world number three Garbine Muguruza, who beat wildcard Renata Zarazua to set up a second-round match with Alison Riske.
Number two seed Magdalena Rybarikova will play Jana Fett of Croatia after beating Risa Ozaki of Japan, while number three seed Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine beat Nao Hibino to set up a match with Danielle Collins. Elsewhere there was disappointment for Watson, who crashed out of the Volvo Car Open following a seventh straight defeat.
The British number two lost to Taylor Townsend 6-3 6-4 after the American capitalised on Watson's tentative display. She has now suffered early exits at every tournament since her run to the semi-finals of the Hobart International in January.
Townsend will go on to play Elena Vesnina, while Britain's number six seed Johanna Konta will play qualifier Fanny Stollar.
In other matches top seed Caroline Garcia saw off Varvara Lepchenko to reach round three, while number three seed Daria Kasatkina also progressed to the third.
Kristyna Pliskova won and will play number two seed Petra Kvitova in the second round. US Open finalist Madison Keys, the number seven seed, will play Lara Arruabarrena.
