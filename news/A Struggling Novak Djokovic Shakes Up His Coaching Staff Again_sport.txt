Novak Djokovic is done working with Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek, the latest in a series of coaching changes for the 12-time major champion, who has gone nearly two full years without winning a Grand Slam title.
Djokovic announced Wednesday on his website that he has split from Agassi after less than a year and from Stepanek after less than six months.
He has lost his past three matches.
