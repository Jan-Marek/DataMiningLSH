Lamb tikka kebabs and apricot cauli rice
½ lemon
½ tsp turmeric
1 brown onion
1 red pepper
1 tbsp tikka masala spice
200g cauli rice
2 x 150g diced lamb leg
40g spinach
4 skewers
4 tsp oil
50g dried apricots
6 cardamom pods
In a bowl, mix the tikka spice with 1 tbsp oil and a pinch of sea salt. Add the diced lamb, stir to coat and set aside to marinate until needed. Finely slice the onion. Cut the red pepper into bite-sized pieces and slice each dried apricot into quarters. Remove the cardamom seeds from the pods, lightly bruise the seeds with a rolling pin or crush in a pestle and mortar and discard the green shells.
Thread a piece of lamb and piece of red pepper alternately onto each of the 4 skewers. Preheat a griddle pan (or frying pan) on a medium-high heat and add the skewers, cook for 10-12 mins, turning every 2-3 mins, until cooked. Meanwhile, in a medium-sized pan, heat 1 tsp oil on a medium heat and cook the onion, cardamom seeds and turmeric for 5 mins until the onion has softened. Then add the dried apricots, cauli rice, 1 tbsp cold water and cook for 3 mins, stirring frequently.
Then stir in the spinach and the juice from the half lemon to the cauli rice and cook for a further 2 mins until the spinach has wilted. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Serve the lamb tikka kebabs on two warm plates alongside the apricot and cardamom cauli rice.
