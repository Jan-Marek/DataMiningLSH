Federal officials added new urgency on Thursday to the hunt for a drug kingpin convicted of orchestrating the 1985 death of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, announcing that the fugitive had been added to the F.B.I.’s 10 most wanted list.
The notorious kingpin, Rafael Caro Quintero, who rose to prominence as a marijuana and cocaine trafficker in the 1980s, has evaded the authorities since he was released on a legal technicality from a Mexican prison in 2013.
Mr. Caro Quintero was serving a 40-year sentence for the kidnapping, torture and murder of Enrique Camarena, known as Kiki, who was working undercover in Mexico as a D.E.A. agent.
The announcement on Thursday put new pressure on the Mexican authorities in a case that has long been a source of friction. Tensions between the two countries are already high, as President Trump has incorrectly called Mexico the “most dangerous country in the world,” and has pointed to its problems with violence as justification for his proposed border wall.
The move also comes as the United States and Mexico struggle to contain a cartel-fueled drug trade streaming across the southwestern border.
