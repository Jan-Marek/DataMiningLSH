The crashing waves and turbulent seas of the Volvo Ocean Race have never been captured in more dramatic style than when Sam Greenfield first brought drone footage to the event often dubbed the world's toughest race.

This year's Volvo Ocean Race is 46,000 nautical miles, traversing four oceans, six continents and 12 host cities. The event's nine-month long progress can be tracked online, where competitors are currently on their sixth leg between Hong Kong and Auckland.
