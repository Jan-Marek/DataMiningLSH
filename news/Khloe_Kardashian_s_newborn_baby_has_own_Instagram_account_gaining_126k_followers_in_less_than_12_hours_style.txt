Khloe Kardashian might’ve only given birth to her baby daughter a few days ago, but it looks like the newborn is already being groomed for fame as she has her own Instagram account.
Posting about the birth on her own Instagram profile, grandmother Kris Jenner tagged "@true", linking to an account which has already racked up 126,000 followers in less than 12 hours.
The five-day-old tot has yet to make her debut post.
With no posts and just "True Thompson" written on the profile, it's currently unclear as to whether the account is actually run by a member of the Kardashian family.
Jenner also explained the reason for the baby’s unusual moniker, revealing its family origins:
“FUN FACT… my grandfather’s name on my dad’s side was True Otis Houghton… my dad’s name was Robert True Houghton… so I am so excited Khloe named her daughter True!!”
The Kardashian matriarch’s post has been liked more than one million times.

Khloe revealed the name via her own Instagram account in a post that has since garnered more than four million likes, writing: “Our little girl, True Thompson, has completely stolen our hearts and we are overwhelmed with LOVE. Such a blessing to welcome this angel into the family! Mommy and Daddy loooooove you True!”
Publicity surrounding the birth of Khloe’s first child has been rife - and not just because she is part of one of the world’s most famous families.
Shortly before the 33-year-old gave birth, allegations surfaced that boyfriend and NBA star Tristan Thompson had cheated on her, however, he’s believed to have been by her side during labour, TMZ reports.
The couple started dating in August 2016 and live together in Cleveland, Ohio.
Despite Kardashian and Jenner both doing separate announcement posts, Thompson has yet to publicly acknowledge the birth via social media; his most recent post, uploaded six days ago, was a paid partnership.
