Jordan Spieth labelled his play "brain-dead" after almost blowing his chances of a second Masters title.
Spieth held a two-shot overnight lead at Augusta National, but saw that disappear with a double-bogey on the opening hole of his second round and further dropped shots on the second and seventh.
The three-time major winner failed to record a birdie on the front nine for the first time in his career as he struggled to the turn in 40, but fought back to shoot 74 and join Rory McIlroy in the clubhouse on four under par.

1/18 1st (Tea Olive), 445 yards, par four deep bunker on the right of the fairway and trees both sides make for a daunting start, while long and left of the undulating green both spell big trouble.
2/18 2nd (Pink Dogwood), 575 yards, par five Driving into the trees on the left cost Padraig Harrington a nine in 2009, but Louis Oosthuizen memorably holed his second shot for an albatross in the final round in 2012 before losing in a play-off to Bubba Watson. An important early birdie chance.
3/18 3rd (Flowering Peach), 350 yards, par four Shortest par four on the course but a pear-shaped green with steep slope in front allows for some wicked pin positions. Charl Schwartzel pitched in for eagle in the final round en route to title in 2011.
4/18 4th (Flowering Crab Apple), 240 yards, par three The back tee - not always used - turns it into a beast with the green sloping from back to front. Phil Mickelson took six here in the final round in 2012 and finished two shots outside the play-off. Jeff Sluman's ace in 1992 remains the only hole-in-one here in Masters history.
5/18 5th (Magnolia), 455 yards, par four Jack Nicklaus twice holed his second shot in 1995 and Colin Montgomerie did it in 2000, but it is another devilishly difficult green. To clear the fairway bunkers requires a 315-yard carry.
6/18 6th (Juniper), 180 yards, par three From a high tee to a green with a huge slope in it. Five holes-in-one - including Jamie Donaldson in 2013 - but Jose Maria Olazabal took seven in 1991 and lost by one to Ian Woosnam, while Arnold Palmer has also run up a seven.
7/18 7th (Pampas), 450 yards, par four What used to be a real birdie chance has been lengthened by 35-40 yards, while trees were also added and the putting surface reshaped. More bunkers - five - around the green than any other hole.
8/18 8th (Yellow Jasmine), 570 yards, par five The bunker on the right, about 300 yards out, pushes players left and from there it is harder to find the green in two up the steep hill. Still a good birdie chance and Bruce Devlin made an albatross two in 1967.
9/18 9th (Carolina Cherry), 460 yards, par four The tee was pushed back 30 yards in 2002. The raised green, with two bunkers on the left, tilts sharply from the back and anything rolling off the front can continue down for 50-60 yards.
10/18 10th (Camellia), 495 yards, par four A huge drop from tee to green on this dogleg left and over all the years of the Masters the most difficult hole. It was here that Rory McIlroy began to fall apart in 2011 with a seven, while Watson clinched the title in 2012 by making par in the play-off from the trees.
11/18 11th (White Dogwood), 505 yards, par four The start of Amen Corner. Toughest hole in 2011, 2014 and 2015, with the water front and left scaring many. Best remembered for Larry Mize's chip-in in 1987 and Nick Faldo's back-to-back play-off wins.
12/18 12th (Golden Bell), 155 yards, par three Probably the most famous par three in golf. Narrow target, water in front, trouble at the back, it has seen everything from a one to Tom Weiskopf's 13 in 1980. McIlroy four-putted it in 2011.
13/18 13th (Azalea), 510 yards, par five The end of Amen Corner. Massive dogleg left with scores ranging from Jeff Maggert's albatross two in 1994 to Tommy Nakajima's 13 in 1978. Bubba Watson's enormous drive here in 2014 left him with just a sand wedge into the green to set up a birdie.
14/18 14th (Chinese Fir), 440 yards, par four The only hole on the course without a bunker, but three putts are common on the wickedly difficult green. Course record holder Nick Price took eight here in 1993, while Phil Mickelson holed his approach en route to 2010 victory.
15/18 15th (Firethorn), 530 yards, par five Often a tough decision whether to go for the green in two across the pond on the hole where Gene Sarazen sank his 235-yard four-wood shot for an albatross in 1935. There have also been three 11s here.
16/18 16th (Redbud), 170 yards, par three Tiger Woods' memorable chip-in in 2005 came the same year as 73-year-old Billy Casper's 14, while Padraig Harrington and Ian Poulter are among 15 players to record holes-in-one.
17/18 17th (Nandina), 440 yards, par four The famous Eisenhower Tree has been removed after suffering storm damage, making for an easier tee shot on the hole Justin Rose double-bogeyed when one off the lead in 2007. Jack Nicklaus birdied here to take the lead as he won his 18th major in 1986.
18/18 18th (Holly), 465 yards, par four The drive through an avenue of trees was made much harder when the tee was moved back 60 yards in 2002. The fairway bunker from which Sandy Lyle got up and down to win in 1988 is now 300 yards away.
"The first few holes I just hit it everywhere you can't hit it," said Spieth, who had led or shared the lead after nine of his previous 17 rounds in the Masters.
"I got a little brain-dead to start but to still be in the tournament after two rounds, would I have taken being in this position three or four weeks ago? Absolutely. The wheels could have come off but I made a great par save on the ninth to be able to go to the back nine with some momentum."
Spieth led from start to finish in 2015 and for 54 holes in defence of his title the following year, only to squander a five-shot lead with nine holes to play.
"I've taken a lot of punches on this golf course and I told Michael (Greller, his caddie) that I'm good for a double bogey or some bogeys here, so let's make these the only ones," the 24-year-old added.
"To not be in the lead could bode well for me, allow me to go after some pins to get some shorter looks at birdie."
