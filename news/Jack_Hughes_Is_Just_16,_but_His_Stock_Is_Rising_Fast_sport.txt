PLYMOUTH, Mich. — Two years ago, Auston Matthews became the seventh American-born player to be taken first over all in the N.H.L. draft.
The question of who will be the next one may already have an answer: a skinny 16-year-old named Jack Hughes.
Hughes, a native of Orlando, Fla., who grew up in the Toronto area in an accomplished hockey family, will not be eligible for the N.H.L. draft until 2019. But he has emerged as such a star for U.S.A. Hockey’s National Team Development Program that pro and college scouts are penciling in the left-shooting center as the odds-on favorite for the top spot 14 months from now.
“I have not seen a better player available for the 2019 draft,” said Craig Button, a former general manager of the Calgary Flames and now an analyst on the NHL Network. “He’s got the skill, he’s got the drive. He’s lights out. If there’s a better player available for 2019, just tell me where he is, because I’ll take a buggy, a bicycle, a plane, if there’s someone out there better than Jack Hughes.”
