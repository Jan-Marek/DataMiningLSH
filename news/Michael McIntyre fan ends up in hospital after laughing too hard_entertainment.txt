A Michael McIntyre fan ended up hospitalised after suffering severe chest pains during one of his shows.
Jessica Owen, a 19-year-old student, told The Evening Standard of her experience: "My chest started to really hurt with sharp pains and my arm went numb. It was pretty scary. We decided to leave ASAP and get it check out."
Once she'd undergone an ECG in A&E, doctors found an unusual explanation for her distressing symptoms: her chest had inflamed from laughing too much.
"The doctor asked where I had been and he said ‘It’s obvious what you’ve done ... you’ve laughed too hard!’," she said. She's since made a full recovery.
Ms. Owens added that she contacted McIntyre on Facebook about the incident and was offered tickets to see the show at a venue of her choice later on in the year.
She had been in attendance of the opening weekend of McIntyre's Big World Tour in her hometown of Plymouth. The comedian is currently touring both the UK and Ireland after a string of shows in the US.
