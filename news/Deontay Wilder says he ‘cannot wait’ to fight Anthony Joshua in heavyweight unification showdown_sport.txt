Deontay Wilder has said that he “cannot wait” to take on Anthony Joshua in a heavyweight title unification showdown.
Joshua immediately called out Wilder after his unanimous points victory over Joseph Parker on Saturday night, as he added the WBO titles to his own WBA, IBF and IBO belts.
Wilder, the WBC champion since January 2015, holds the one remaining heavyweight title and said on Tuesday night that he is eager to fight Joshua in a lucrative unification bout.

1/13 Round 1 Cagey. Very cagey. Joshua probably just edged that one. He held the centre of the ring very well but there was not too much to note about that round really. Concentration all over Joshua's face.

2/13 Round 2 Another really close round. Both men went for a few more shots. Joshua got a couple through the gate and Parker was going for a few body shots. Still very cagey.

3/13 Round 3 The crowd has quietened slightly this round as they look to be given something to cheer about. Joshua twice obliges with shots at Parker up against the ropes. There is an accidental head clash that throws the Briton slightly towards the end of the round that the referee warns both about but Joshua is still on top. Just.

4/13 Round 4 A big left jab from Joshua looked like it hurt Parker briefly there as Joshua holds the centre of the ring and pushed his rival into the ropes. Joshua catches him again with another left hook and a third to finish the round. He's eased into this one but looks comfortable. There is swelling around Parker's left eye now too.

5/13 Round 5 Parker is been hurt by yet another left at the start of this round. He's trying to lure Joshua in and attack but he finally finds success with it. A flurry of punches hurries Joshua into the corner and another shot is landed.

6/13 Round 6 Both men go at it here and swing wildly! They take shots and both land them. The referee breaks it up and the crowd come alive! Parker lands a couple more and he looks dangerous. Joshua needs to stem this momentum from the Kiwi.

7/13 Round 7 A left jab catches Joshua and Parker is a tad stunned. The two lock up and Parker snatches a few body shots which Joshua takes exception to and aims a wild uppercut his way after the referee calls the break. Parker gives AJ a wry smile as the bell rings.

8/13 Round 8 Parker continues to go in low and the referee doesn't like it, but Parker won't like what's coming next as Joshua lands a big left and wraps the Kiwi up against the ropes as he ducks into him. He can't quiet capitalise but he is back on top as the bell brings the round to an end.

9/13 Round 9 Joshua predicted Parker would tire in the ninth or 10th and he could be right. He lands a few shots before complaining about Parker's head use. There is a brief pause as Joshua gets his gloves re-taped after it comes loose and Parker gets a bit lively after, but the bell calls an end to the round just as it starts to spice up.

10/13 Round 10 Parker's been cut above his left eye and Joshua, like a shark, goes straight to work on it. The crowd sense it too but Parker sees it off for now. Joshua has him up against the ropes and swings with a wild left that would have surely ended it there and then. Parker survives.

11/13 Round 11 Only a knockout will do for Parker so expect him to really go for it. But he doesn't really and Joshua keeps him at distance. Parker keeps coming but the two get wrapped up and Joshua lands an uppercut and another jab. A left seems to wobble Parker but a body shot by the Kiwi immediately hurts AJ. A good finish to the round.

12/13 Round 12 Only a knockout will do for Parker. Joshua just needs to survive, keep his distance. A body shot from Joshua wakes up the crowd and another jab draws more cheers but there is nothing more to capitalise on. That’s it, some boos from the crowd as Joshua is taken the distance for the first time in his career.

13/13 It’s a convincing victory for Joshua from all three of our judges, with Luke Brown only giving Parker one round and both Jack Austin and Jack de Menezes handing the New Zealand three. It wasn’t Joshua’s most entertaining fight of his career, or his most dominant, but as wins go that one was pretty regulatory.

His manager, Shelly Finkel, has already said that he will contact Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn this week, with the American poised to accept a 40/60 purse split.
Wilder said: “First of all, I want to congratulate Anthony Joshua on his win last Saturday night. Anthony, I am so glad we finally heard from you on Saturday and that you want to fight me as your next opponent and you want the fight to happen in the UK.
“I accept that challenge and I am ready to come to the UK for my next fight.”
Wilder made his comments on Tuesday night in a short statement, released after a media conference call with the US fighter was postponed.

“There is nothing on Team Wilder's side to prevent me from fighting you next,” he added.
“You also said on Saturday that your team is ready to meet with Shelly Finkel and Al Haymon from my side to get this deal done. They are also ready to meet with your team immediately. Let us know when - the sooner the better.
“Thanks Anthony, I cannot wait to meet you in the ring.”
