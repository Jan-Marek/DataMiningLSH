Steven Spielberg, one of the pioneers of the New Hollywood era, has hit 11 figures at the box office across his career.
He is the first director in history to achieve this feat and is ahead by some way, with numbers two, three and four on the list of highest-grossing directors - Peter Jackson, Michael Bay and James Cameron - currently all on $6 billion.
Ready Player One pushed Spielberg over the $10 billion mark to $10.009 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. It has taken $114 million thus far, making it only his seventeenth most successful film to date, with the Spielberg movies with the biggest lifetime gross being E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
A two-time Best Director Oscar-winner, Spielberg has an estimated net worth, according to Forbes, of $3.6 billion.
