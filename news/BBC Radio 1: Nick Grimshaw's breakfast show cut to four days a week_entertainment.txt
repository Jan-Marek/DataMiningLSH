BBC Radio 1 has revealed a massive overhaul of its line-up, with the weekend schedule now starting on Fridays.
The move marks the first time in Radio 1 history that daytime DJs will be on a four-day week, although presenter Chris Evans once tried to take Fridays off when he hosted the breakfast show - a request that was denied by then-controller Matthew Bannister.
Ben Cooper, the current controller of BBC Radio 1, said in a statement: “The weekend will start here at Radio 1 on a Friday morning giving our young audience that feel-good factor a day early.
“It’s our job at Radio 1 to reinvent the way young people listen to the radio, to disrupt traditional thinking and to look for new ways in which to grow audiences.”
Changes include Scott Mills hosting the chart show, and new Friday shows for Maya Jama and The Saturdays’ Mollie King – her first permanent show on the station.
King said: "I've grown up listening to Radio 1 and I can't wait to be one of the team. This is an absolute dream for me! The only person more excited than me is my mum - who is delighted I finally have a proper job."
I’m SO excited to announce I’m officially a Radio 1 presenter! 😬 From June you’ll be able to tune in to ‘Matt and Mollie’ every week on Friday, Saturday AND Sunday! I literally can’t wait!! Dreams do come true guys, go out there and get them!! @MattEdmondson @BBCR1 💫🎧 pic.twitter.com/GPvq7mN9CT — MOLLIE KING (@MollieKing) April 10, 2018
Dev and Alice Levine will present the breakfast show from Friday to Sunday. Greg James, Clara Amfo, and Nick Grimshaw will go down to hosting four shows a week as a result.
Mills also expressed his excitement, saying: "I was sat with my mum when I got this news, and she actually cried because I've been pretending to do the chart show on Radio 1 since I was 8-years-old.
"I've filled in on the show so much over the years, and I can't believe it's actually mine. I'm beyond excited."
