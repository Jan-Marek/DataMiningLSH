Story highlights Osaka stuns Serena in first round of Miami Open
Japan star enjoying rich vein of form
Serena draw prompted controversy over protected seedings after maternity leave
(CNN) Naomi Osaka is in the form of her life.
In the past fortnight, four current and former world No. 1s have entered her path, and four have fallen by the wayside.
And if the manner in which the young Japanese star stormed to her first major title in Indian Wells last week was impressive, what stood out on Wednesday was the confidence and style with which she swept aside Serena Williams at the Miami Open.
Osaka had never faced Williams before, but -- like so many players of her generation -- had grown up idolizing the American.
"I was extremely nervous coming on to the court. I don't know if anybody knows this but Serena is my favorite player," Osaka said after the match.
"Sometimes when I'm in a really hard position when I'm serving, I'm like 'what would Serena do?...' but I was playing her."
