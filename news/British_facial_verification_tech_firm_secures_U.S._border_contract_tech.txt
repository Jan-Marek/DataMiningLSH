LONDON (Reuters) - A British technology firm has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to use biometric facial verification technology to improve border control, the first foreign firm to win such a contract in the United States.
London-based iProov will develop technology to improve border controls at unmanned ports of entry with a verification system that uses the traveller’s cell phone.
British trade minister Liam Fox said in a statement on Monday that the contract was “one example of our shared economic and security ties” with the United States.
IProov said it was the first non-U.S. firm to be awarded a contract under the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), which is run by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate.
