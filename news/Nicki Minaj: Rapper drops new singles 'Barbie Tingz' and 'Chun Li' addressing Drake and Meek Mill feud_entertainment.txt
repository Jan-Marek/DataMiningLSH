Nicki Minaj dropped her much-anticipated new singles "Barbie Tingz" and "Chun Li" on Thursday.
The rapper also announced a new record before dropping the two songs.
She told Zane Lowe of Beats 1, "This is the best album I’ve ever, ever, ever in my life created."
The New York rapper also addressed the previous feud between her ex Meek Mill and collaborator Drake.
"It was one of the hardest parts of my career, to date," she said. "Because at the time I did love both of them and I couldn’t erase the love that I had for my team, but I also couldn’t speak out… It was difficult to stay out of it."
Minaj added that she was "wishing it never happened" during the time.
"Even prior to it happening I tried to stop it," she continued. "I said [to Meek], ‘Don’t do that.'"
While Minaj's album The Pinkprint was released in 2014, she's done collaborations since with Fergie, Ariana Grande, Bebe Rexha, Katy Perry and Migos, alongside Cardi B.
In January, Minaj also had a starring role in Quality Control and Quavo's music video for "She For Keeps."
The hip-hop queen has not yet announced an album release date.
