Own-brand product removed from shelves after shards of glass were identified in one batch
Sainsbury's recalls beetroot over fears it may contain glass
Sainsbury’s has recalled a sliced beetroot product over fears it could contain small shards of glass.
Customers who have bought the 340g jar of the supermarket’s own-brand beetroot, with the item code 7860491, were advised not to eat it.
Instead they should return the product, which has a best before date of August 2019 and a batch code L318N 1737, Sainsbury’s said.
The move was described as a precautionary measure after pieces of glass were identified in one batch.
“The presence of glass makes this product unsafe to eat and presents a safety risk,” said a notice on the Food Standards Agency website.
Sainsbury’s apologised for the inconvenience. A customer notice said: “We … are asking all customers who have bought this product … not to consume it and to return it to their nearest Sainsbury’s store where they will receive a full refund.”
