Following the success of It: Chapter 1, fans have wondered when the cast for Chapter 2 will be announced (the second half of Stephen King’s book takes place 27 years after the first, when the Loser’s Club return to their hometown to face Pennywise again).
Already, we know Jessica Chastain will play Beverly, the red headed female member of the club, first portrayed by Sophia Lillis.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, James McAvoy and Bill Hader have both entered negotiations to appear in the sequel.

McAvoy would play Bill Denbrough, the unofficial leader of the group who becomes a successful writer and was first played by Jaeden Lieberher. Hader would take on Finn Wolfhard's former role, the comic relief Richie Tozier.
Bill Skarsgard will return as Pennywise for the sequel, which will once again be directed by Andy Muschietti and penned by Gary Dauberman. Wolfhard, Lieberher, and Lillis, along with the other members of the Loser's Club, will likely return in flashbacks.
