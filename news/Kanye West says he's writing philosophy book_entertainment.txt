Kanye West is writing a book on philosophy called Break the Simulation.
The rapper opened up about the project in an interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt in The Hollywood Reporter, revealing that the book would cover art and spirituality.
In the conversation, he described his obsession with photographs and the relationship people have with them.
"I've got a concept about photographs ... about human beings being obsessed with photographs â€“ because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future," West said. "It can be used to document, but a lot of times it overtakes [people]. People dwell too much in the memories."
He believes "there's too much of an importance placed on history" when it comes to photographs.
West's wife Kim Kardashian has also taken an interest in photographs over the years - selfies in particular.
In 2015 she released her coffee table book Selfish - a collection of selfies.
While West didn't bring that up in the internet, he did call Kardashian "a Marie Antoinette of our time."
"A designer told me that my wife was a master of light and I was a master of time," said West. "How to use time is equal to being someone who can cut a diamond. The ability to preserve time is more valuable than the ability to preserve a diamond because time is our most valuable resource. So using something timeless to remind us of what time is, is a good bar."
West released his last album The Life of Pablo in 2016.
There has been no release date set for his next record.
