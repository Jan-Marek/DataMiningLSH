Earlier this year, Tom Hardy released the first image of himself as Al Capone, the actor sporting a shaven head and looking fairly miserable trapped in Alcatraz.
Hardy has since posted further photos, this time offering a clearer look at the makeup and prosthetics being used to recreate the infamous Chicago gangster’s looks.
“Mega awkward character misstep,” Hardy wrote alongside the post, the Mad Max: Fury Road actor looking almost unrecognisable as they have attempted to age him up considerably.
Hardy is currently working with Fantastic Four director Josh Trank on the biopic Fonzo, principle photography having started earlier this year.
The movie will focus on Capone’s latter years, when the iconic figure suffered dementia.
According to the production notes, the story will also see “his past becomes present as harrowing memories of his violent and brutal origins melt into his waking life.”

Previous versions of Capone have focussed on the gangster’s time as “public enemy number one” during the American prohibition. Fonzo does not have a release date.
Al Capone has been portrayed on screen by multiple award-winning actors, including Rod Steiger, Robert De Niro, and Ben Gazzara.
Hardy has been very busy recently, working on the Spider-man spin-off Venom, while a second season of Taboo has also been announced.
