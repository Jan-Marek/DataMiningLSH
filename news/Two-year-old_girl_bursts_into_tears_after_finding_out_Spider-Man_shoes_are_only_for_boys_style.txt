As young children many of us fantasise about becoming our favourite superheroes.
However, one little girl’s dreams were dashed when a pair of Spider-Man shoes caught her eye at the Target supermarket, only to find out that the footwear was targeted solely at boys.
Sharing her story on Twitter, her father Qasim Rachid explained how upset she had been upon the discovery and expressed his own dismay over the situation.
The father of three said she broke down at a branch of the shop in Virginia.
His two youngest started arguing when his daughter became envious of her older brother’s Spider-Man shoes, he said.
“Hey @Target I bought my four-year-old son Spider-Man shoes and now my two-year-old daughter wants Spider-Man shoes too,” Mr Rashid, an author and attorney, wrote on Twitter.
“But you don’t sell Spider-Man shoes that fit two-year-old girls. Even when I search for them - boys shoes are the only result. She’s crying now. It’s heartbreaking.”
Hey @Target I bought my 4-year-old son Spider-Man shoes & now my 2-year-old daughter wants Spider-Man shoes too.
But you dont sell Spider-Man shoes that fit 2 year old girls. Even when I search for them—boys shoes are the only result.
She's crying now. It's heartbreaking. Thx😕 pic.twitter.com/pxTI9R3OP3 — Qasim Rashid, Esq. (@MuslimIQ) April 6, 2018
Update: She took her brothers shoes and I’m just gonna let it fly like this. pic.twitter.com/h2rpvPGnBL — Qasim Rashid, Esq. (@MuslimIQ) April 6, 2018
There are currently four different kinds of Spider-Man shoes available on the Target website.
However, all four variations are described as “boys” shoes.
While some may argue that it does not matter what the shoes are labelled as, others would state that it’s not fair that little girls should be made to feel as though superhero merchandise has been designed exclusively for boys to enjoy.
“I think we’re close to a post-modern age where the clothes and shoes are all just there by size; not gender,” one person wrote on Twitter. “Nobody should pass up Spider-Man sneakers.”
Another parent commented below Rashid’s tweet explaining how he’s faced a similar scenario with Super Mario Bros apparel.
“Same problem with Super Mario Brothers stuff! My kids are crazy about it but there’s NOTHING for my seven-year-old girl.” he wrote.

Screw Target. There are dozens of spider-man shoes available for boys AND girls. Stay strong, little one. — Ripley (@AlienDay426) April 7, 2018
As a girl who made her mom make her a He-Man Halloween costume when she was about your daughter's age, I approve ☺ — Sarah Joan (@By_SJD) April 8, 2018
Mr Rashid has since posted a video on Twitter that shows his daughter happily walking around their home wearing her brother’s shoes.
“This @Target shoe-gate may seem small, but I promised my daughter everything I’ve promised my sons - and I have promises to keep,” Rashid wrote.
On the Disney store website, there’s a pair of Spider-Man shoes available described as being for “kids” as opposed to one specific gender.
The Independent has reached out to Target for comment.
