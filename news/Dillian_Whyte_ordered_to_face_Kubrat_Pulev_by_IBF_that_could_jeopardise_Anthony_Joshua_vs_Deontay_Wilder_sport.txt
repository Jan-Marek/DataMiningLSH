Dillian Whyte has been ordered to fight Kubrat Pulev in what looks to be his path towards a rematch with Anthony Joshua, with the winner set to become the mandatory challenger to the IBF heavyweight title.
Whyte has plenty of options for his next fight, having knocked out Lucas Browne last week in devastating circumstances that strengthened his claims to join the world title mix, and the ‘Body Snatcher’ immediately called out WBC champion Deontay Wilder to face him later this year.
But with Joshua also eyeing a unification fight against Wilder and talks due to begin this week over a blockbuster clash later this year, Whyte will need to consider other options for his next bout that could shoot him up to the top of the contenders list in facing Joshua.

1/13 Round 1 Cagey. Very cagey. Joshua probably just edged that one. He held the centre of the ring very well but there was not too much to note about that round really. Concentration all over Joshua's face.

3/13 Round 3 The crowd has quietened slightly this round as they look to be given something to cheer about. Joshua twice obliges with shots at Parker up against the ropes. There is an accidental head clash that throws the Briton slightly towards the end of the round that the referee warns both about but Joshua is still on top. Just.

4/13 Round 4 A big left jab from Joshua looked like it hurt Parker briefly there as Joshua holds the centre of the ring and pushed his rival into the ropes. Joshua catches him again with another left hook and a third to finish the round. He's eased into this one but looks comfortable. There is swelling around Parker's left eye now too.

5/13 Round 5 Parker is been hurt by yet another left at the start of this round. He's trying to lure Joshua in and attack but he finally finds success with it. A flurry of punches hurries Joshua into the corner and another shot is landed.

6/13 Round 6 Both men go at it here and swing wildly! They take shots and both land them. The referee breaks it up and the crowd come alive! Parker lands a couple more and he looks dangerous. Joshua needs to stem this momentum from the Kiwi.

7/13 Round 7 A left jab catches Joshua and Parker is a tad stunned. The two lock up and Parker snatches a few body shots which Joshua takes exception to and aims a wild uppercut his way after the referee calls the break. Parker gives AJ a wry smile as the bell rings.

8/13 Round 8 Parker continues to go in low and the referee doesn't like it, but Parker won't like what's coming next as Joshua lands a big left and wraps the Kiwi up against the ropes as he ducks into him. He can't quiet capitalise but he is back on top as the bell brings the round to an end.

9/13 Round 9 Joshua predicted Parker would tire in the ninth or 10th and he could be right. He lands a few shots before complaining about Parker's head use. There is a brief pause as Joshua gets his gloves re-taped after it comes loose and Parker gets a bit lively after, but the bell calls an end to the round just as it starts to spice up.

10/13 Round 10 Parker's been cut above his left eye and Joshua, like a shark, goes straight to work on it. The crowd sense it too but Parker sees it off for now. Joshua has him up against the ropes and swings with a wild left that would have surely ended it there and then. Parker survives.

11/13 Round 11 Only a knockout will do for Parker so expect him to really go for it. But he doesn't really and Joshua keeps him at distance. Parker keeps coming but the two get wrapped up and Joshua lands an uppercut and another jab. A left seems to wobble Parker but a body shot by the Kiwi immediately hurts AJ. A good finish to the round.

12/13 Round 12 Only a knockout will do for Parker. Joshua just needs to survive, keep his distance. A body shot from Joshua wakes up the crowd and another jab draws more cheers but there is nothing more to capitalise on. That’s it, some boos from the crowd as Joshua is taken the distance for the first time in his career.

13/13 It’s a convincing victory for Joshua from all three of our judges, with Luke Brown only giving Parker one round and both Jack Austin and Jack de Menezes handing the New Zealand three. It wasn’t Joshua’s most entertaining fight of his career, or his most dominant, but as wins go that one was pretty regulatory.

Whyte was in attendance on Saturday night at the Principality Stadium to see Joshua defeat Joseph Parker, and it was there that both he and promoter Eddie Hearn claimed that a verbal agreement was in place for Whyte to face Alexander Povetkin, following his brutal knockout victory over David Price.
But Hearn announced late on Monday night that the IBF have now order Whyte to face Pulev, who was due to fight Joshua last year only to pull out after suffering a shoulder injury. The Bulgarian has not fought in nearly a year, with his victory over Kevin Johnson on 28 April 2017 remaining the last time that the 36-year-old has been seen in the ring, and with Whyte already the No 1 contender for Wilder’s WBC belt, victory over Pulev would see him installed as the mandatory challenger for Joshua’s IBF title too.

Writing on Twitter, Hearn said: “Just received a letter from the IBF ordering a final eliminator for the mandatory position between @DillianWhyte and @KubratPulev – interesting times for the division!”
With Pulev ranked second and Whyte fourth with the IBF, the winner could potentially muddy the waters over a Joshua vs Wilder superfight depending on when the planned bout takes place. Whyte said on Saturday that he would be open to fighting again as early as July, which could jeopardise Joshua’s plan to face Wilder in September as the IBF could order Joshua to face either Whyte or Pulev or be stripped of the title.

The fate of the belt will likely rest with Hearn, given that he promotes Whyte as well as Joshua, and he could look to negotiate a situation that would allow Joshua to face Wilder and then either Whyte or Pulev. If not, the likelihood is that Joshua will not get a chance to face Wilder until 2019, when it’s hoped that former world champion Tyson Fury will also be back in the mix as he targets a comeback.
