FRISCO, Tex. — Easton Stick threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Darrius Shepherd, and North Dakota State took back the Football Championship Subdivision title, beating James Madison, 17-13, on Saturday.
The victory came a year after the Bison’s five-year run atop the F.C.S. ended against the Dukes in the semifinals.
North Dakota State (14-1), whose 33-game winning streak from 2012 to 2014 is an F.C.S. record, ended James Madison’s run at 26, denying the Dukes a second straight title and spoiling what would have been their first season without a loss or a tie.
The championship was the Bison’s sixth, tying them with Georgia Southern for the most F.C.S. titles.

“It’s a legacy,” said linebacker Nick DeLuca, who was injured and missed last year’s 27-17 loss to James Madison. “That’s everything that we work for, and all those workouts, all that extra stuff we do in the off-season, it’s for this moment and for this stage. Just happy to get back here.”

The Dukes (14-1), who trailed by 17-3 late in the first half, had a chance to win after punter Harry O’Kelly ran 24 yards on a fake. But Bryan Schor’s desperation throw to the end zone on fourth-and-16 fell incomplete with 58 seconds left.
