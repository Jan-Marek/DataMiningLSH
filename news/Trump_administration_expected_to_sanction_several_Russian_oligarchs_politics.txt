(CNN) President Donald Trump's administration is expected to sanction "several" Russian oligarchs with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin over 2016 election interference, according to two senior administration officials.
The officials said the sanctions will likely come later this week.
The planned sanctions would be the latest public step the US has taken against Russia in an ongoing tit-for-tat of punitive measures. The US and Russia last month continued to push each other's officials out of their borders in a further round of expulsions from diplomatic outposts.
The US call for Russian officials to leave the country was done in tandem with a wide array of other nations collectively pushing out Russians after the March 4 poisoning of a former spy and his daughter in the United Kingdom, which the UK and the US have pinned on the Kremlin.
