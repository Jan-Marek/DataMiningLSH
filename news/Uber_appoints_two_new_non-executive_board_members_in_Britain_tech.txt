The taxi app is battling to keep its cars on the streets of the British capital city after London’s transport regulator deemed it unfit to run a taxi service, in a decision the Silicon Valley firm is appealing.
Since then it has made a series of changes to its business model, responding to requests from regulators, including the introduction of 24/7 telephone support and the proactive reporting of serious incidents to London’s police.
It also appointed Laurel Powers-Freeling, who has held a series of banking roles, as its first British chair last year.
On Friday it said Susan Hooper, who is currently a non-executive director at Wizz Air and the Brexit ministry, and Roger Parry, whose current roles include being non-executive chairman at YouGov, had been appointed to its British boards.
