Family favourite is still No 1, while high-concept horror A Quiet Place opened with a buzz and Love, Simon breaks the teen comedy mould
The winner: Peter Rabbit
The Easter school holiday is the gift that keeps on giving – at least to Sony, which once again ruled the UK box office with its live-action/animated hybrid Peter Rabbit. The family friendly Beatrix Potter adaptation scored a fourth consecutive weekend at the top spot, with takings of £3.15m taking the tally up to £32.2m. In the past seven days, Peter Rabbit added a mighty £10.6m. Most kids are still on holiday this week, so look for the box-office bonanza to continue.
Few films achieve four weeks at the chart summit. Last year, it was a feat that eluded box office giants Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Beauty and the Beast, and was achieved in 2017 only by Dunkirk. This year, Peter Rabbit follows four straight weeks at the top spot for Black Panther – which with £48.4m has just overtaken Avengers: Age of Ultron to become the second biggest Marvel film ever at the UK box office, after Avengers Assemble (£51.9m).
The buzzy newcomer: A Quiet Place
The highest new entry in the chart – in second place – is A Quiet Place, the high-concept horror directed by John Krasinski. The Paramount-backed film debuted in the UK with £1.99m over the weekend period, and £2.70m including previews.

The obvious comparison for A Quiet Place is Jordan Peele’s Get Out: the surprise breakout genre hit from March last year. Get Out debuted with £2.16m in the UK, on its way to a total of £10.3m.
A Quiet Place was also released in North America at the weekend, opening with a mighty $50.2m. Worldwide, it’s at $71.2m. Given that its production budget was just $17m, the film is on track to become a profitable hit, even allowing for significant marketing costs.
Breaking the mould: Love, Simon
Films featuring LGBT characters have been hits in the past, notably Brokeback Mountain, which reached $178m worldwide. In the case of teen movies, films with prominent LGBT storylines have tended to exist firmly in the indie sphere – Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader, for example.
Love, Simon is something different. A bright, glossy and unapologetically mainstream US teen movie, Love, Simon has opened in the UK with a robust £1.01m for the weekend period, and £1.18m including previews. Not only is that a record for a gay-themed teen comedy – it’s also the best result for any US teen comedy for quite a while.
The genre has been in the doldrums, with teen-targeted hits instead coming from YA adaptations (such as The Maze Runner and The Fault in Our Stars), and before that from dance movies such as the Step Up franchise. The last notable US teen comedy hit was The Hannah Montana Movie, back in 2009 (£8.5m). From the UK, of course, we’ve had The Inbetweeners Movie (£45.0m) and its sequel.
The flop
Eli Roth’s Death Wish remake, starring Bruce Willis, has bellyflopped at the UK box office, landing in 14th place with £157,000 from 209 cinemas. Death Wish debuted in the US in early March with $13m – by accepted rule of thumb, an equivalent result in the UK market would be around £1.3m, so the achieved outcome is way below that number.
Also performing poorly is US indie drama-thriller Thoroughbreds, starring Olivia Cooke and Anya Taylor-Joy as two disaffected teens plotting a murder. The film struggled to define its audience, and has opened with a lacklustre £51,000 from 128 sites.
The market
What a difference a week makes. Last week we reported that box office for the year to date (to 29 March) was down 9% on the equivalent period in 2017. A very robust performance during the Easter school holiday has narrowed that gap, and the market is now down just 4% on 2017 for the year to 5 April.
For the weekend just ended, box office is down 9% on the equivalent session from 2017, when The Boss Baby was the top new title. For the coming frame, cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on Rampage – star Dwayne Johnson is just coming off huge hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (£38.2m). Also in the mix is Truth or Dare from genre hit-maker Jason Blum.
