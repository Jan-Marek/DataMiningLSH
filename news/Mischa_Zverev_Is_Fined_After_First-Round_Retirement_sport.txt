MELBOURNE, Australia — The new Grand Slam policy that shows generosity toward injured players also has an unforgiving side, as Mischa Zverev learned Tuesday at the Australian Open.
A new rule, instituted this year on a trial basis by the Grand Slam board, offers injured or ailing players half of their first-round prize money if they pull out before the match. The change was intended to curb first-round retirements because of pre-existing injuries or ailments. After four players accepted the offer at this tournament, it was hailed as a success.
A week later, however, the harsher side of the rule was implemented for the first time: Zverev, the only man or woman to retire from a first-round singles match, was fined roughly $36,000 after he quit midway through his second set against Hyeon Chung after 48 minutes, trailing by 2-6, 1-4.
The rule states, “Any player who competes in the First Round Main Draw and retires or performs below professional standards, may be subject to a fine up to First Round Prize Money.”

Bill Babcock, the director of the Grand Slam Board, said that investigations would precede any penalty for performances considered below those standards. He declined to comment on Zverev’s penalty because the player has appealed his punishment.
