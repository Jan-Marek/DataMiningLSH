SINGAPORE — Martina Hingis announced Thursday that she will retire from tennis at the end of this week’s WTA Finals, where she is playing in the doubles tournament with Chan Yung-Jan.
“Looking back now, it’s hard to believe that almost exactly 23 years ago I made my professional debut,” Hingis, 37, said on her Facebook page.
“The years that followed have been some of the most rewarding years of my life, both personally and professionally, but I believe the time has come for me to retire, which I will be doing after my last match here in Singapore.”
The retirement will be Hingis’s third in a long and illustrious career during which she claimed 25 Grand Slam titles — five in singles, seven in mixed doubles and 13 in women’s doubles.

Hingis first decided to end her career as a 22-year-old in 2003 because of persistent injuries after picking up all five of her major singles titles as a teenager. She won three Australian Opens, one Wimbledon and one United States Open from 1997 to 1999.
