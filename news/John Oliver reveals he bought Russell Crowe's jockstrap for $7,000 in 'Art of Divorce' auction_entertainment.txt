If you were curious as to what kind of person would drop $7,000 for Russell Crowe's jockstrap from Cinderella Man, that answer is: John Oliver.
The late-night host revealed on Last Week Tonight that the show had used a pile of HBO's cash to purchase the memorabilia piece from Crowe's "Art of Divorce Auction", which saw the actor de-clutter his collection to mark his divorce from singer Danielle Spencer.
After rumours flared up that Oliver was behind the purchase, the host gleefully confirmed the news, while declaring: “$7,000! That is a big price to pay just to find out what Russell Crowe’s balls smelled like in 2005.”
However, Oliver and his team didn't stop there: also purchased were Crowe's director's chair from American Gangster, alongside Denzel Washington's; the vest he wore in Les Miserables, alongside the hood we wore in 2010's Robin Hood; with the satin robe and gym shorts from Cinderella Man also featuring.
However, it was all for a good cause. Every single last piece of purchased memorabilia will be donated to the last remaining Blockbuster store in Anchorage, Alaska.
So if you want to see Russell Crowe's jockstrap from Cinderella Man in person, you know where to go.
