The covers for JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series are almost as iconic as the books themselves – who can forget the image of the red Hogwarts Express behind the young Harry?
Of course, there have been many variations for each novel, but the latest has fans all riled up with excitement.
To mark 20 years since The Sorcerer’s Stone (that’s Philosopher’s Stone for us Brits) was initially released in the US, a set of seven black-and-white covers have been released.
Designed by famed American illustrator Brian Selznick, the covers not only look great, but they contain a massive secret: link them all together and you realise they all connect to make one huge artwork.
