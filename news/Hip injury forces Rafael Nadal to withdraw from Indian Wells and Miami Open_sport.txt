Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the forthcoming Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments because of injury.
Nadal, who pulled out of the Mexican Open in Acapulco earlier this week, continues to be hindered by a hip injury that has plagued him for several months.
The 31-year-old world No 2 broke the news on his official Facebook page saying he needs to recover from the same injury that prevented him from taking part in the Australian Open in January and told his fans he hopes to be back playing in both American tournaments next year.
The 16-time major winner wrote: “Hi everyone. Unfortunately, the injury I suffered in Acapulco before starting the tournament is in the same area as the one suffered in Melbourne.
“I won’t be able to play in Miami or Indian Wells as I need to recover.
“It was very painful to retire from Acapulco and it’s very hard as well to not play in the USA.
“I will miss you and I will do everything that’s possible to be back there in 2019. Thank you.”
Nadal hopes to be ready to defend his French Open title in June as he looks to win his 11th title at Roland Garros.
