Khloe Kardashian has given birth to a baby girl.
The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star had her daughter alongside sisters Kourtney and Kim, mum Kris and Khloe's best friend Malika Haqq, according to TMZ.
The father of Khloe’s baby - Cleveland Cavaliers star Tristan Thompson - was reportedly in the delivery room as well despite rumours of infidelity and news via Daily Mail on Wednesday that he was seen kissing another woman.
The 33-year-old reality TV star and fashion designer announced her pregnancy news in December with an Instagram post of Thompson holding her stomach.
In the post she wrote, “My greatest dream realised! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can’t believe that our love created life!”

She added, “Thank you to everyone for the love and positive vibes. I know we’ve been keeping this quiet and we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately.”
Khloe got pregnant shortly after her sisters Kylie and Kim (via surrogate).
