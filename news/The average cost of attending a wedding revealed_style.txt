Wedding season is wonderful for so many reasons. You get to travel to new places, see old pals and watch two people celebrate their love surrounded by their closest friends and family.
But, it’s also seriously expensive.
While the average UK wedding might cost £27,161 – and more than £38,000 in London – it has also become ever more extortionate for guests to attend.
In fact, a new survey of 1,040 Brits by Provident has revealed that guests pay an average of £1,015 on the big day, and twice as much if it’s abroad.
The research factors in pre- and post-celebration additions including hotels, wedding gifts, outfits and the hen or stag do.
Celebratory drinks, meals and engagement party ensembles are also included in the costs.
But of course, all of this depends on which guest type you are.
The nationwide survey found that bridesmaids are spending on average £1,058 to attend the average wedding while best men and women fork out £1,211.

However, it’s the parents of the bride who must part with the most cash spending on average £1,450 to attend their own daughter’s wedding.
Similarly, the price also varies if the happy couple choose to get married overseas, which research has found one in six do.
In this case, guests at abroad weddings are spending an extra £1,035 on flights, hotels, insurance and luggage totalling a shocking £2,050 on average.
To help guests estimate just how much they’ll need to see them through the upcoming wedding season Provident has also launched a handy wedding guest calculator.
Simply pick the type of wedding guest you will be, the location and which parts of the celebrations you’ll be attending, and you’ll be given an estimated sum as to how much the entire thing could cost you.
