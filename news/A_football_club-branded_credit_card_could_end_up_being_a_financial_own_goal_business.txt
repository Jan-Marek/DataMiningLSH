With the new Premier League season kicking off today, football fans across the country will be donning new replica shirts and scarves, while some supporters will take loyalty further by carrying a club-branded credit card.
It may be a great talking point and often a bit of a wind-up when you get your football club plastic out in front of your mates, but these deals aren't the best option for all fans and by choosing the wrong card you could end up scoring a financial own goal.
MBNA remains the primary provider when it comes to football affinity credit cards, currently behind the deals for almost 30 clubs – not just the premiership big boys, but also some of the cash-strapped lower-league teams.
Creation is the other influential company in the area and currently has cards for six football league clubs, although its financial terms are less attractive.
A prime example is that even though the 0 per cent balance transfer term is a mere six months on the Creation football cards, the one-off balance transfer fees of 5 per cent are way out of line compared with a market average of 2 to 3 per cent.
So sign up for these particular cards, by all means, if they're linked to a club you support – but make sure you steer clear of the Creation balance transfer deals as they are more Football Conference than Football League.
Aside from the pride of carrying your club colours in your purse or wallet, simply spending on your football credit card can deliver a welcome cash injection to the coffers of your favourite team.
Club-by-club guide to the 2015-16 season
19 show all Club-by-club guide to the 2015-16 season
1/19 Arsenal Position last year: 3rd Players in: Petr Cech (Chelsea). Players out: Ryo Miyaichi (St Pauli), Abou Diaby (Marseille), Lukas Podolski (Galatasaray), Carl Jenkinson (West Ham, loan), Wojciech Szczesny (Roma, loan). Missing link: A world-class centre forward perhaps, although some claim Alexis Sanchez will fit that bill. Prospects: Only four points off second place last time, as well as FA Cup winners again. With the attacking players free of injury and Petr Cech at the back, this could see Arsenal’s best title challenge for a while. Key man: Alexis Sanchez. Prediction: 2nd Getty Images
2/19 Aston Villa Position last year: 17th Players in: Rudy Gestede (Blackburn), Scott Sinclair, Micah Richards (both Man C), Mark Bunn (Norwich), Idrissa Gueye (Lille), Jordan Amavi (Nice), Jordan Ayew (Orient), Jose Crespo (Cordoba), Jordan Veretout (Nantes). Players out: Fabian Delph (MC), Christian Benteke (Liv), Darren Bent, Andreas Weimann (both Derby), Ron Vlaar (unatt), Matt Lowton (Burnley), Antonio Luna (Eibar), Shay Given (Stoke). Missing link: Benteke’s goals, Delph’s creativity. Prospects: Tim Sherwood needs all his ability to lift them any higher. Key man: Gabriel Agbonlahor. Prediction: 16th Getty
3/19 Bournemouth Position last year: 1st [Championship]. Players in: Artur Boruc (S’hampton), Adam Federici (Reading), Josh King (Blackburn), Tyrone Mings (Ipswich), Sylvain Distin (Everton), Christian Atsu (Chelsea, loan). Players out: Ian Harte (unatt), Ryan Fraser, Brett Pitman (Ipswich, loan). Missing link: Premier League experience, which can be partially offset by the confidence gleaned from success over the last six years. Prospects: Don’t underestimate their quality, bright young manager and financial firepower. Can surprise many people and stay up. Key man: Harry Arter. Prediction: 15th RUSSELL SACH
4/19 Chelsea Position last year:1st Players in: Radamel Falcao (Monaco, loan), Asmir Begovic (Stoke), Nathan (Paranaense). Players out: Didier Drogba (Montreal), Petr Cech (Arsenal), Josh McEachran (Brentford), Filipe Luis (Atletico), Christian Atsu (B’mouth, loan), Gael Kakuta (Sevilla), Marco van Ginkel (Stoke, loan), Patrick Bamford (C Palace, loan). Missing link: Cover in key areas, including defensive midfield. Prospects: Torn between retaining the title and a first Champions League win, Jose Mourinho could fall between two stools if last season’s luck with injuries changes. Key man: Diego Costa. Prediction: 3rd Getty Images
5/19 Crystal Palace Position last year: 10th Players in: Yohan Cabaye (Paris Saint-Germain), Patrick Bamford (Chelsea, loan), Alex McCarthy (Queens Park Rangers), Connor Wickham (Sunderland). Players out: Stephen Dobbie, Jerome Thomas (both unattached). Missing link: They possess lots of strikers but, unlike last season, one of them must hit double figures. Prospects: Both excellent signings, Cabaye and Bamford were just what Crystal Palace needed to maintain the momentum established under Alan Pardew. Further progress is possible. Key man: Yohan Cabaye. Prediction: 8th
6/19 Everton Position last year: 11th Players in: Tom Cleverley (Man United), Gerard Deulofeu (Barcelona), David Henen (Olmpiakos). Players out: Antolin Alcaraz (unatt), Sylvain Distin (Bournemouth). Missing link: Some excitement, much missed by supporters who want to believe in Roberto Martinez but often found the football dull. Prospects: Having dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since 2006, Everton have not strengthened sufficiently to convince that they can improve. Things may get worse before they do. Key man: Ross Barkley. Prediction: 13th Getty
7/19 Leicester City Position last year: 14th Players in: Christian Fuchs (Schalke), Robert Huth (Stoke), Shinji Okazaki (Mainz). Players out: Chris Wood (Leeds United), Esteban Cambiasso (unattached). Missing link: The players they haven’t managed to sign yet after sacking last season’s successful manager rather late in the day. Prospects: A relegation struggle in prospect for Claudio Ranieri on his return to management in England after 11 long years. Unlike Nigel Pearson’s sterling effort, it may not succeed. Key man: Jamie Vardy. Prediction: 17th Getty
8/19 Liverpool Position last year: 6th Players in: Christian Benteke (Aston Villa), Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton), Roberto Firmino (Hoffenheim), James Milner (Man City), Danny Ings (Burnley), Adam Bogdan (Bolton), Joe Gomez (Charlton). Players out: Steven Gerrard (LA Galaxy), Glen Johnson (Stoke), Brad Jones (unatt), Sebastian Coates (Sunderland), Raheem Sterling (Man City), Andre Wisdom (Norwich, loan). Missing link: One missing in LA, another in east Manchester. Prospects: Will surely score more goals than last season’s feeble 52. Key man: Christian Benteke. Prediction: 5th Getty
9/19 Manchester City Position last year: 2nd Players in: Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Fabian Delph (Aston Villa), Patrick Roberts (Fulham), David Faupala (Lens). Players out: Scott Sinclair (Villa), James Milner (L’pool), Dedryck Boyata (Celtic), Stevan Joveitc (Inter, loan) Missing link: None apparent, until Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany or Sergio Aguero are injured. Prospects: Spending another £50million-plus in defiance of those irritating Financial Fair Play rules should help them become top scorers again and quite possibly to regain the title. Key man: Sergio Aguero. Prediction: 1st Getty Images
10/19 Manchester United Position last year: 4th Players in: Memphis Depay (PSV Eindhoven), Matteo Darmian (Torino), Bastian Schweinsteiger (B Munich), Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton), Sergio Romero (Sampdoria). Players out: Tom Cleverley (Everton), Nani, Robin van Persie (both Fenerbahce), Ben Amos (Bolton), Will Keane (Preston, loan). Missing link: A settled squad with clearly defined first-team and tactics. Prospects: Having been fourth in such an uneven campaign under a new manager, should be able to hold off Liverpool and do the same again. Key man: Too many to name. Prediction: 4th Getty Images
11/19 Newcastle United Position last year: 15th Players in: Georginio Wijnaldum (PSV Eindhoven), Aleksandar Mitrovic (Anderlecht), Chancel Mbemba (Anderlecht). Players out: Davide Santon (Internazionale),Jonas Gutierrez (unatt), Ryan Taylor (Hull), Sammy Ameobi (Cardiff, loan). Missing link: Confidence, initially, after winning two games out of 15 from the end of January onwards. Quality will take longer. Prospects: A new start under Steve McClaren, who may have pulled out a plum in young Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic. Key man: Chieck Tioté. Prediction: 14th PA
12/19 Norwich City Position last year: 3rd [Championship]. Players in: Graham Dorrans, Youssouf Mulumbu (both West Bromwich), Robbie Brady (Hull), Andre Wisdom (Liverpool, loan), Jake Kean (Blackburn Rovers). Players out: Mark Bunn (Aston Villa). Missing link: The men who will score the sufficient amount of goals and those who will keep them out. Prospects: Heavy and consistent scorers last season in the Championship, but the fact that they conceded 48 goals at a lower level does not bode well for the newcomers this season. Key man: Bradley Johnson Prediction: 19th Getty Images
13/19 Stoke City Position last year: 9th Players in: Jakob Hau-gaard (Midtjylland), Philipp Wollscheid (Bayer L), Joselu (Hannover), Marco van Ginkel (Chelsea, loan), Shay Given (A Villa), Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Ibrahim Afellay (Barcelona). Players out: Thomas Sorensen (retired), Wilson Palacios (unatt), Steven Nzonzi (Sevilla), Asmir Begovic (Chelsea). Missing link: Without Mame Biram Diouf’s late flurry of goals, nobody would have managed even 10. Prospects: Will need decent contributions from those new to the League, and could remain top Midlands club. Key man: Jack Butland. Prediction: 11th Getty Images
14/19 Sunderland Position last year: 16th Players in: Sebastian Coates (Liverpool), Adam Matthews (Celtic), Jeremain Lens (Dynamo Kiev), Younes Kaboul (Tottenham). Players out: El-Hadji Ba (Charlton), Santiago Vergini (Getafe, loan). Missing link: Goals, goals, goals. And Connor Wickham, joint top scorer (with five) has left the club. Prospects: Dick Advocaat may have stayed after all but uninspiring signings to add to a team three points off relegation suggest that it may have been only a postponement; like his departure. Key man: Jermain Defoe. Prediction: 18th Getty
15/19 Swansea City Position last year: 8th Players in: Andre Ayew (Marseille), Franck Tabanou (St Etienne), Kristoffer Nordfeldt (Heerenveen), Eder (Braga). Players out: Alan Tate (unattached), Gerhard Tremmel (unattached), Jazz Richards (Fulham). Missing link: A midfield hard-man alongside all the neat footballers. Prospects: Wilfried Bony’s departure in January did not have the feared effect and, if Andre Ayew proves a good foil for Bafetimbi Gomis, they will remain in good shape as well as easy on the eye. Key man: Bafetimbi Gomis. Prediction: 7th GETTY IMAGES
16/19 Tottenham Hotspur Position last year: 5th Players in: Kevin Wimmer (Cologne), Kieran Trippier (Burnley), Toby Alderweireld (Atletico Madrid). Players out: Vlad Chiriches (Napoli), Paulinho (Guangzhou E), Lewis Holtby (Hamburg), Etienne Capoue (Watford), Younes Kaboul (Sunderland), Benjamin Stambouli (PSG). Missing link: Any sort of striking back-up to Harry Kane – and a midfield enforcer. Prospects: Mauricio Pochettino appears to be putting all his eggs in a Kane basket, while jettisoning the bad buys of the past two years. Key man: Harry Kane Prediction: 6th GETTY IMAGES
17/19 Watford Position last year: 2nd [Championship]. Players in: Sebastian Prodl (W Bremen), Giedrius Arlauskis (S Bucharest), Jose Holebas (Roma), Matej Vydra (Udinese), Etienne Capoue (Tottenham), Valon Behrami (Hamburg), Allan Nyom (Granada), Miguel Britos (Napoli), Jose Jurado (S Moscow), Steven Berghuis (Alkmaar). Players out: Jonathan Bond (Reading), Lewis McGugan (Sheff Wed), Diego Fabbrini (Middlesbrough, loan). Missing link: Likely to concede too many goals. Prospects: Avoiding an immediate descent would appear the only target. Key man: Heurelho Gomes. Prediction: 20th Getty Images
18/19 West Bromwich Albion Position last year: 13th Players in: James McClean (Wigan), James Chester (Hull), Rickie Lambert (Liverpool). Players out: Graham Dorrans, Youssouf Mulumbu (both Norwich), Chris Baird (Derby), Georgios Samaras (unattached). Missing link: Apart from Saido Berahino, nobody scored more than four league goals, which Rickie Lambert now has to do. Prospects: Having a key man who could yet depart is a concern, even with Lambert on board. As long as Berahino stays, Tony Pulis should keep them steady. Key man: Saido Berahino Prediction: 12th Getty
19/19 West Ham United Position last year: 11th Players in: Darren Randolph (Birmingham), Pedro Obiang (Sampdoria), Dimitri Payet (Marseille), Angelo Ogbonna (Juventus), Carl Jenkinson (Arsenal, loan), Manuel Lanzini (Al-Jazira, loan). Players out: Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough), Dan Potts (Luton), Carlton Cole, Guy Demel, Jussi Jaaskelainen, Nene (all unattached). Missing link: Unknown element to signings makes assessment difficult. Prospects: The Europa League has given Slaven Bilic time to assess his squad, but Downing will be missed. Key man: Diafra Sakho. Prediction: 10th Getty Images
The funds donated from the cards make a vital financial contribution to the grass-roots player development of your club, thus helping the first-team players of tomorrow. If you sign up for a card the youth training academy at your club will receive up to £20 when you first use it and there's a further contribution every time you spend on the card. In the past 14 years the partnership with MBNA has resulted in more than £10m donated to teams.
The interest rates at 18.9 per cent APR representative are in line with the market average but if you can't afford to pay your balance off in full each month you would be better opting for a cheaper deal such as the Halifax Low Rate credit card at 6.4 per cent APR or MBNA's own 6.6 per cent low-rate deal, and making a separate donation to your club.
MBNA Football Credit Cards offer 24 months interest free on balance transfers, a full year less than the best non-football cards. However you can transfer cash from the cards direct to your bank account for a one-off money transfer fee of 4 per cent – which could prove to be a low-cost way to clear a nagging and expensive overdraft.
For fans who always pay their statement in full every month, these cards won't hurt your finances and can get you decent discounts in the club shop and the chance to win "money can't buy" and VIP days at your club
Some of the Creation deals also allow you to spread the cost of your season ticket over nine months, interest free, which could prove a useful option when funds are tight.
However, if you keep a big balance on your card, then look for a lower rate non-football card and don't be blinded by club loyalty as it could cost you far more than the value of the benefits you receive.
