From Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty to Victoria Beckham’s collaboration with Estée Lauder and rumours that Serena Williams is set to launch her own cosmetics line, celebrities are taking the beauty industry by storm, and now you can also add Jennifer Lopez to that ever-growing list.
A woman whose unique look has even earned its own name – the JLo glow – Lopez has confirmed that she will be launching a makeup range alongside one of the world’s leading manufacturers in colour cosmetics, Inglot.
After her makeup artist Scott Barnes let the secret out on Instagram by revealing that the queen of glow was making a bronzer, Lopez herself posted a series of photos to the social media platform to unveil the news that a collaboration will be hitting stores in a matter of weeks.
“It is something I have been wanting to do for a very long time,” Lopez told Women’s Wear Daily.
“A makeup line seemed like a natural progression since people are always asking about the products I use and how I get the glow to my skin.”
So what can you expect the range to include?
Unlike many other celebrity collaborations, this one looks set to be epic with an impressive 70 items including eye shadows, lipsticks, palettes, blushes, highlighters, bronzers and even nail polishes.
As for the price point, Lopez has confirmed that it will be “affordable”, insisting that being able to produce products that were quality but also inexpensive was an important reason she decided to partner with Inglot.
The entire range will be available from 26 April at select Macy’s stores in the US and at jenniferlopezinglot.com, which ships to the UK.
