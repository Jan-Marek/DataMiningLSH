College football teams locked in their incoming freshman classes on Wednesday as National Signing Day unfolded. For some fans, tracking recruiting’s winners and losers can generate as much passion as the actual games in the fall and winter. But how well do precollege rankings, painstakingly calculated by outlets such as Rivals, Max Preps, Scout and 247Sports, translate to onfield success?
A look back at the past 10 years of Rivals’ No. 1 overall recruits, as well as other highlights from each signing day class, shows that the the answer is: not as much as you might think. Several top picks have been relative busts, and only one — defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, now of the Houston Texans — blossomed into a star in college and the N.F.L. The list is more proof that projecting high school success into college and beyond is an inexact science; the experts’ top rankings each year overlooked four Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks and the supremely talented Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr.
The results reveal clearer truths about the college game. Six of the last 10 No. 1s were defensive linemen, a nod to the importance of stopping the run and pressuring the quarterback. Half came from states in the Southeastern Conference’s footprint, and eight went to teams in that league, which has produced nine of the last 12 national champions.
When the dust settled Wednesday, this year’s top class — depending on one’s opinion — belonged either to Georgia, an SEC team and last season’s national title runner-up, or Ohio State, the one team outside the region that under Coach Urban Meyer has consistently recruited at similar levels. This year’s top prospect, the Georgia high school quarterback Trevor Lawrence, already had signed with Clemson, which has made the College Football Playoff the past three years. Recruiting is not a competition for the underdogs.
