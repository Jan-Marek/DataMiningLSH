Share details of your favourite rural and urban viewpoints from the length and breadth of the UK
Send us a tip on a great view in the UK for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher
Contribute with Guardian Witness
You don’t have to go up mountains to come across great viewpoints in the UK – although it helps of course. Coastal footpaths on dramatic cliffs, trails and roads among gently rolling hills, dynamic cityscapes – there is a wide variety of possibilities that offer stunning vistas, sometimes with interesting historical stories and perhaps well known paintings and photographs attached.
In around 100 words tell us about your discoveries and favourites, perhaps including details of routes to get there and advice about the best time of the year to visit and nearby pitstops. Photographs are welcome but don’t worry if you don’t have a great picture of the view – it’s the text we’re judging.
Send us your recommendations via GuardianWitness (including website, accommodation and prices etc, if possible).
The best tips will appear in print in Guardian Travel and the winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab.
