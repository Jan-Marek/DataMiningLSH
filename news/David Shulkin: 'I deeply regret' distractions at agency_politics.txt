Washington (CNN) Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin on Thursday sought to put what he described as "distractions" behind him, telling House lawmakers that he's focused on getting his department on track and working for veterans.
But later Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested that the secretary, under fire for ethics violations and in conflict with members of the administration, may not have the White House's full support.
"The President has a large number of individuals that are working hard to make sure that the VA is helping veterans at the best level possible," Sanders told reporters. "We are continuing to review if there are anything that we can do to improve on that system. And if we make changes, we will let you know."
Asked whether that may include replacing VA leadership, Sanders said she had no personnel announcements, but that "every day we're looking at how we can better the system, whether it's through policy changes or personnel changes, not just at the top level, but across the board."
Shulkin won unanimous Senate confirmation last year, and frequently appeared alongside the President during his first year on the job due to bipartisan wins he racked up on Capitol Hill. But his standing with the White House has soured amid disputes with Trump administration political appointees and the White House over how to best care for the nation's veterans.
