MANCHESTER, England — There were times in the first half, as Manchester City swept through Manchester United again and again, when it felt as if the plates had shifted, once and for all.
Manchester City was two goals ahead, but the lead should have been three, or four, or five. In the Etihad Stadium stands, its fans were dizzy, delirious, fizzing with that manic feeling of a dream coming true, not sure whether to stare in awe at the field or turn and taunt the United fans penned behind one goal.
Pep Guardiola’s City team was not just going to win the Premier League here, now. It was going to do so in the most perfect of circumstances — at home and against its greatest rival, the neighbor with the bigger house, the better car, the prettier children, the one that does not just cast a shadow but also blocks out the light — and in the most exquisite of styles.
