Billy Connolly has been knighted at Buckingham Palace for his services to entertainment and charity later today (31 October).
The comedian and actor received the honour mere weeks before of his 75th birthday.
Upon discovering that he was to be handed the knighthood following the Queen's birthday honours list in June, he told the BBC: “I am a little embarrassed but deep within me, I'm very pleased to have it. I feel as if I should be called Lancelot or something. Sir Lancelot, that would be nice. Sir Billy doesn't quite have the same ring.
“I wish my sister was here. My sister Flo died last year and she would have loved that, and my parents are both dead, so I wish they were here to see it," he added.
Connolly has been battling ill health recently, announcing he was being treated for symptoms of Parkinson's disease back in 2013.
The Glaswegian - who is nicknamed 'The Big Yin' - has refused to shy away from his illness, instead incorporating it into his stand-up routines in typical straight-talking fashion.
Connolly, who floated as a folk musician in the late 60s, began his stand-up career in the 70s. He has continually been a strong advocate for charity work and is a patron of the National Association for Bikers with a Disability as well as a fervent supporter of Comic Relief.
His film credits include The Last Samurai, Quartet and final Hobbit film The Battle of the Five Armies.
