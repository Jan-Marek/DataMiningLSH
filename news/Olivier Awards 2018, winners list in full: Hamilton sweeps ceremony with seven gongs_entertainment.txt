The annual Olivier Awards took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Sunday 8 April.
Hamilton undoubtedly dominated the night: the hip hop musical scooped seven gongs out of 13 nominations, matching Matilda's 2012 record for the most Olivier awards won by a musical. It claimed awards including Best New Musical, Best Actor in a Musical, and Outstanding Achievement in Music.
Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit show about US founding father Alexander Hamilton also took home awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Musical, Best Theatre Choreography, Best Sound Design, and Best Lightning Design.
