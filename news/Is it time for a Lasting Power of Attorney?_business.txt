Our parents are getting frail so any guidance on how to go about this would be much appreciated
Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.
This week’s question:
Our parents are increasingly frail, aged 89 and 90, but mentally with-it. We (their children) think it’s time to set up a Lasting Power of Attorney, but are nervous about bringing up the topic. Does just one sibling become the attorney? Should we use (an expensive) solicitor? Do it ourselves? Any guidance from families that have been through this much appreciated.
