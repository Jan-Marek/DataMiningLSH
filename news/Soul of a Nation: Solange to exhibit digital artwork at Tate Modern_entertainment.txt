Solange will exhibit a digital artwork at the Tate Modern in London as part of the 'Soul of a Nation' show.
"Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power” runs until 22 October.
Solange's piece is called Seventy States and is billed as a "digital interactive dossier" - featuring unused music video video concepts for "Cranes In The Sky" and "Don’t Touch My Hair" off her critically acclaimed album A Seat At The Table.
Spin reports that her contribution to the exhibition will contain two poems, a brand new piece of music and a performance from Solange called We Sleep In Our Clothes.
Seventy States is a “reflection on Black womanhood and the themes of Black identity within [Solange’s] own work".
Solange recently spoke out in support of Takiyah Thompson, a 22-year-old student at Carolina Central University, who was arrested for taking down a Confederate monument.
​“What we got to do to get my new hero Takiyah Thompson free,” she tweeted shortly before deleting her Twitter account.
She had also condemned the "racist ugly ass f*** bois" who attended a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
