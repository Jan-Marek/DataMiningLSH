Fans have been desperate for Paul Thomas Anderson and Adam Sandler to reunite after 2003's Punch-Drunk Love - it arguably provided the star with his best role, for one.
That wish may finally have been answered to some small degree, with the director spotted outside of El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, a camera on his shoulder as he captured footage of Sandler's name in lights.
The actor-comedian performed at the venue with his show An Evening with Adam Sandler for an upcoming Netflix special. He'll perform again Wednesday night at Los Angeles' Dynasty Typewriter at the Hayworth Theatre.
However, a source close to the production informed Indiewire that, "Steve Brill is directing and Paul Thomas Anderson filmed a portion of Adam's stand-up set in Los Angeles on April 10".
Brill himself is a previous collaborator of Sandler's, directing the likes of The Do-Over, Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and last year's Sandy Wexler.
The stand-up special forms part of Sandler's ongoing deal with Netflix, which included original films like The Ridiculous 6, Sandy Wexler, and the upcoming The Week Of.
However, the inclusion of Anderson does also hint at Sandler's increasing shift towards awards-friendly fare; he starred last in Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and recently signed on to Uncut Gems, directed by Good Time's Benny and Josh Safdie.
