‘What? Working With President Trump Is Frustrating?’
Speaker Paul Ryan’s surprise decision not to run for re-election is being attributed in part to the difficulty of working with President Trump. Stephen Colbert feigned surprise at the idea that it might be hard to do business with the president.
“What? Working with President Trump is frustrating? That’s not what the last 30 people who quit said!” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Fare thee well, Paul Ryan, we’ll all miss your famous catch phrase: ‘No, I hadn’t heard what the president said, but if true, that is troubling.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT
Jimmy Fallon took a more direct shot at Ryan.
“Paul Ryan is retiring. He said that after 20 years in Congress, it’s time to let someone else get nothing done.” — JIMMY FALLON
After Ryan’s announcement, Trump sent the speaker a warm message via Twitter. Colbert couldn’t help but poke fun at that too.
“Yes, Republicans are with you, Paul. And by ‘with you,’ they mean leaving office in November.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
Collusion Confusion
Seth Meyers pointed out that in another Twitter message on Wednesday, Trump had a funny way of denying collusion with Russia.
