British fashion label Mother of Pearl has officially launched its “Pearly Whites” bridal capsule collection.
Not being a typical wedding dress kind of girl, the idea was born when creative director Amy Powney was deciding what to wear to her own wedding last year and, after failing to find something she liked in regular bridal stores, created her own outfit at her east London studio.
“I’m not a traditional wedding gown girl, but as a designer, I had the luxury of making my own outfit,” Powney says.
“I decided I wanted to offer options to other women out there who like me, don’t want to get married in a conventional wedding dress. The Pearly Whites line features beautiful, easy-to-wear pieces handmade in our studio.”
So, what can you expect from the collection?
The debut of the new line features everything from a calf-skimming shift dress with lightly puffed sleeves, shoulder ruffles and a round neck faux pearl collar, to a loose shift dress with long fluted sleeves and a cut-away shoulder also embellished with studded faux pearls.
However, dress-phobes will appreciate the inclusion of a slinky pyjama-style suit that features a loose shirt with ruffle shoulder details and high-waisted wide leg trousers with a faux pearl paperbag waist.
But, that’s not even the best part. The brainchild of a woman who has spent much of her 2017 Vogue/BFC Designer Fashion Fund prize money on making Mother of Pearl more eco-friendly, the entire collection is also made using organic materials and is socially responsible.
The Pearly Whites collection is now available to buy online from motherofpearl.co.uk.
