Michael Bennett, the Pro Bowl defensive end who recently was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, surrendered to the authorities in Houston on Monday on a charge that he injured a woman in a wheelchair while trying to get onto the field after Super Bowl LI.
Mr. Bennett was a spectator at NRG Stadium in Houston for the game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons on Feb. 5, 2017. The Harris County district attorney’s office said that Mr. Bennett ignored instructions to go to a different field entrance and subsequently pushed past a group of security employees to try to congratulate his brother, Martellus, who had just won the game as a member of the Patriots. Prosecutors said the group of security personnel included a 66-year-old paraplegic woman who sustained injuries during the incident.
After Mr. Bennett’s brief court appearance on Monday, a judge set his bond at $10,000 on a felony count of injury to the elderly. He was expected to post bail and be released.
Speaking to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Mr. Bennett’s lawyer, Rusty Hardin, made it clear that his client denies the charge.

“He just flat-out didn’t do it,” Mr. Hardin said. “It wasn’t a case of, ‘He didn’t shove her that hard,’ or anything like that. He never touched her.”
