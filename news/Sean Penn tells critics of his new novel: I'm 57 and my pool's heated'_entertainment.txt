Sean Penn responded to the numerous haters of his debut novel by saying he's too old and too successful to care.
The Hollywood actor addressed criticism of his debut book Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff while he was on Conan on Thursday night.
Penn's novel chronicles a complex main character who seeks to kill senior citizens.
The actor explained the plot further saying, "There is an issue related to the ozone, and there's a lack of engagement with social media, to a degree, and therefore global consumerism."
He continued, "So, in culling certain demographics, we make a better world."
It gave host Conan O'Brien a chance to address the backlash Penn had been receiving - mainly from the elderly community.
Penn replied that he wrote a book that "starts from page one and doesn't end 'til it ends," explaining that it makes sense if read from start to finish.
He then added, "What I would say is: I'm 57, my pool's heated - you can say anything you like."
Penn had previously said that not everyone would enjoy his book.
When he appeared on CBS Sunday Morning, the actor had acknowledged that he would be criticised for his work.
Earlier this week Penn also appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert where he smoked cigarettes during his interview and revealed he had taken Ambien.
Despite what critics say, it seems like Penn will be fine.
