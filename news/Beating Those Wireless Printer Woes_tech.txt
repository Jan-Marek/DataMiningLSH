Q. I cannot even get my Canon printer on my wireless network in the first place so I can register it or print anything with a Chromebook. Where do I start?
A. Canon makes a large number of different printers, and the wireless setup steps will vary based on the model you have. If you cannot reach anybody on the company’s telephone support lines to walk you through the process, check the technical support area of Canon’s printers site for instructional videos or browse the page devoted to wireless printing. The Canon video library has clips that guide you through the wireless setup for several printers, and you may be able to find one for your specific model. In some cases, you may need a smartphone or a computer to help get the printer on the network.
