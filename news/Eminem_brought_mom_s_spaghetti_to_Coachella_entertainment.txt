Before headlining Coachella on Sunday (15 April), Eminem brought something special to the California festival: mom’s spaghetti.
The rapper opened a restaurant inspired by the “Lose Yourself” lyric in Detroit last year, bringing a pop-up food stand version to Coachella.
Options include a spaghetti with garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs, spaghetti with mozzarella, or just straight spaghetti.
Eminem posted a picture from Coachella to Twitter, while a billboard for Mom’s Spaghetti appeared on a highway going towards the festival.
Meanwhile, the rapper was joined by 50 Cent and Dr. Dre during his headline set, performing hits such as “Patiently Waiting”, “Still Dre”, and “Forgot About Dre”. Watch snippets from the performance here.
Unlike the other headliners, Eminem’s performance was not live-streamed onto YouTube leading to some very disgruntled fans.
