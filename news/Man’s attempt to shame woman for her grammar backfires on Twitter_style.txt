A man’s attempt to shame a woman for the grammar in her Tinder profile completely backfired when Twitter users pointed out that he hadn’t understood the joke.
Jake Cartwright posted a screengrab on Twitter of Nicola Hawkins’ Tinder profile which read: “Talents include: Binge drinking. Knowing the difference between you’re and your. Not you’re average girl, can get ready in 45 minutes.”
Alongside the screengrab, he wrote: “hahah soz niccy don’t think you do know the difference.”

However this then led to many people pointing out that Nicola, 18, was clearly making a joke in her bio.
The tweet quickly went viral, with a wave of people pointing out to Jake that he’d missed the joke.

And Nicola herself replied, pointing out that she does indeed know the difference.

The exchange has attracted a lot of attention on Twitter, with people leaping to the defence of both parties.
Some pointed out that it was clearly a joke and others criticised Jake for not picking up on it. But some Twitter users wondered whether Nicola’s bio really was carefully crafted and said that if it was a joke, they weren’t very impressed with it.
In the world of online dating, there’s arguably nothing worse than a blank bio. Whether writing one as controversial as this will get you more matches, however, remains to be seen.
