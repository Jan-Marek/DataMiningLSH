Rogue One featured numerous references to previous main-saga Star Wars movies, including both major (Darth Vader) and minor (Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba) characters.
Unsurprisingly, the next upcoming spin-off, Solo: A Star Wars Story, will include multiple reference to previous movies, including a hint towards Rogue One.
Eagle-eyed Star Wars fans have spotted a certain character in the background of one scene in the new trailer. Take a look at the photo below.
Notice that body to the right of Solo? Well, that belongs to Tam Posla, a former lawman turned Bounty Hunter who appeared wandering the streets of Jedha in Rogue One, as well as the Doctor Aphra comics.
More information about the character was revealed in the Rogue One Ultimate Visual Guide. See a more detailed photo of Posla below.

What that means for Solo: A Star Wars Story is anyone’s guess. However, Posla currently holds the title of being the only character to appear in both Anthology movies.
