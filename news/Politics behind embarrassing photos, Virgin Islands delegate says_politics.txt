Story highlights US Virgin Islands delegate says politics is behind a topless photo of her posted on the Internet
Del. Stacey Plaskett said a video of her husband wearing make-up was posted online
Cleveland (CNN) The delegate to Congress from the US Virgin Islands is charging that politics are behind the posting on the Internet of a topless photo of her and a potentially embarrassing video that shows her husband wearing make-up.
The US Capitol Police and the FBI are investigating the possible hacking of Del. Stacey Plaskett's iPhone and other personal devices to determine how the images ended up online, her office said.
"The theft and distribution of these personal images via the Internet marks a new low in Virgin Islands politics. I am shocked and deeply saddened that someone would stoop to such a level as to invade my marriage and the love of my family in an attempt to besmirch me politically," said Plaskett, who faces a primary challenge in two weeks, in a lengthy statement on her House website
The images, which were posted on a fake Facebook page and elsewhere, are no longer online and couldn't be viewed by CNN. But an aide to the congresswoman described the video of her husband in make-up as playful and innocent and noted the couple's seven-year-old daughter is in the video.
The aide declined to explain the circumstances of the topless photo.
