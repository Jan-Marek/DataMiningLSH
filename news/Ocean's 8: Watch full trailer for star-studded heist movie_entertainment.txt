The official trailer for Ocean's 8 has arrived and it's full of Hollywood's biggest stars.
The heist film is an all-female led spinoff of the Ocean's 11 series starring Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the sister of George Clooney's Danny Ocean from the original films.
In the movie, Bullock's Ocean gets parole and recruits a team of thieves to help her pull off robing the biggest fashion event of the year: the Met Ball.
Bullock's character is questioned and doubted about making the decision to pull off the heist at such a high-profile event.
"Why do you need to do this?" Lou, played by Cate Blanchett, asks Ocean.
"'Cuz it's what I'm good at," Ocean replies.
In addition to Bullock, the cast stars Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and more.
It's unclear whether or not Hathaway is in on the heist or a victim of their crime, as she's seen appearing on the red carpet at the Met Ball in the trailer
However, it is clear that she is the mark for Ocean's gang.
Ocean's 8 hits theatres June 8.
