How to propose to the love of your life might be one of the toughest decisions you’ll ever make.
Do you play it safe with an intimate, at-home candlelit proposal à la Chandler and Monica in Friends? Or do you push the boat out and go full Richard Curtis on them with a grand romantic gesture?
For Marc Jacobs, it was the latter, as the fashion designer revealed in an Instagram post on Wednesday that he proposed to his boyfriend, Charly ‘Char’ Defrancesco via flashmob.
However, a far cry from the opulent engagement one might expect from the New York-based designer, who is known for his extravagant aesthetic, rather than opting for a swanky setting, Jacobs’ flashmob and subsequent proposal took place in a Chipotle, the popular Mexican-inspired fast-food chain.
Dancing to Prince’s ‘Kiss’, the flashmob can be seen performing in front of the couple before Jacobs conforms to tradition by getting down on one knee to pop the question to his Defrancesco, who works as a model and candlemaker.
Sharing the clip with 963,000 followers on Instagram, the 54-year-old designer wrote: “And this happened… ’Charly Defrancesco will you marry me?’ #flashmobatchipotle #moves THANK YOU everyone for making this happen video@plural_nyc @laurengerrie @seandon212@1.800.newbold And to my Ride or Die fiancé @chardefrancesco I LOVE YOU❤️”
The post has been liked more than 56,300 times, with fans writing congratulatory messages to the couple and praising Jacobs for his creative choice of proposal method.
“Congratulations!!!! You guys deserve it! That was beautiful,” one person wrote.
“Omggggg I teared up. So happy you found your Prince Charming. I love love,” added another.
