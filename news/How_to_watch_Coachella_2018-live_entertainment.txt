Coachella Festival 2018 is well underway, but if you failed to get your hands on a Coachella ticket this year - don't worry.
Instead of waiting in never-ending lines in the scorching desert heat, you can kick back on your couch and livestream the whole festival.
Here's everything you need to know about watching the festival from the comfort of your own home.
Where can I stream Coachella?
YouTube will stream several of the acts from weekend one of the festival via the Coachella Channel, which you can access from any device any April 13 to 15.

Who are the headliners?
This year you've got Beyonce, The Weeknd, and Eminem!
Will the sets be live?
There will likely be a delay with some of the sets - it could be minutes, it could be hours. Headliners normally stick pretty close to their designated time slots: The Weeknd will begin streaming at 11:25pm PT on Friday and Beyoncé will stream at 11:10pm PT on Saturday, just a few minutes shy of their actual start times. Eminem's start time has yet to be announced.
How many performances will be available for streaming?
There are 88 acts currently confirmed for the live stream schedule with the possibility of more being added. You will definitely be able to catch Beyoncé, The Weeknd, SZA, Migos, Vince Staples, Kamasi Washington, Angel Olsen and HAIM.
What's happened so far?
Beyonce became the first black woman to headline Coachella in a breathtaking set that featured her best material from a staggering back catalogue... and set a near-impossible standard for every headliner that will follow her.
Appearing at the festival in Indio, California, Beyonce performed one incredible dance routine after another - those rumoured 10 hour a day rehearsals ahead of the show certainly paid off, as she didn't put a foot wrong - read our piece about the performance here.
Elsewhere, Kendrick Lamar made surprise appearances during sets for Vince Staples and SZA, and Nicki Minaj shared a photo that had everyone pulling a double take.
