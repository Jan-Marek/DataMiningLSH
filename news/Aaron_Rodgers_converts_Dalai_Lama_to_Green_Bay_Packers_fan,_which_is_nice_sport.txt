Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers managed to recruit a new fan during a humanitarian mission to India this week – while perhaps taking a stride toward achieving total consciousness.
The Dalai Lama met with the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player on Tuesday at his residence in Dharamshala, where he was presented gifts of a Packers hat and an official NFL football.
The 82-year-old is shown wearing the hat and gripping the ball alongside Rodgers in a photo posted to the Tibetan spiritual leader’s verified Instagram account.
The six-time Pro Bowler is on a charity trip to India with his girlfriend, race car driver Danica Patrick, distributing hearing aids to those in need on behalf of the Starkey Hearing Foundation.
Rodgers, who was raised by devout Christian parents, spoke at length about his inner conflicts with church dogma and passion for exploring broader matters of religion and spirituality in an ESPN The Magazine profile last year.
The veteran signal-caller missed nine games last season due to a fractured collarbone but is expected to be fully fit when the team’s offseason program starts on Monday.
Which is nice.
