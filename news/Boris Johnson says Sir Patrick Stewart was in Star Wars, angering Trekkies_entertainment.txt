The internet is furious after Andrew Marr and Boris Johnson accidentally said Sir Patrick Stewart was in Star Wars rather than Star Trek.
According to the Radio Times, the reaction came after Marr introduced guest Stewart on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show as "Sir Patrick Stewart, known for X-Men and Star Wars."
In addition to Marr's errors, his second guest on the show also said Stewart had "something to do with Star Wars."
Because Stewart's segment on the show was pre-recorded, he couldn't correct the mistake, but that didn't stop the internet from speaking up on his behalf.

One user implied that sci-fi fans would yell "Nnoooooooo!!!" about the Star Trek and Star Wars confusion.

Another individual wrote, "To boldly go" is Star Trek, not Star Wars Boris, as every nerd in the country is screaming at you now. #marr."

Stewart was appearing on the show as a representative for the People's Vote - an organisation campaigning for a "public vote on the final Brexit deal" once the government agrees on it.
Stewart is best-known for portraying Captain Jean-Luc Picard on Star Trek: The Next Generation.
His character even helped generate a variety of memes over the years.
The Star Trek actor has yet to comment on the mistake.
