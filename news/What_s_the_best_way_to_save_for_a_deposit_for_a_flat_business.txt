Q I have a good credit rating, am disciplined with money and earn £27,000. I am hoping to save about £25,000 to put down as a deposit when I buy a flat costing between £80,000 and £90,000. I will be 48 or 49 when I am ready to buy and would like a mortgage term of 18 years so that it’s paid off just as I retire. (I intend to overpay so hopefully will be paid off more quickly than that.)
I have two questions. First, given my age and the short mortgage term I want, are lenders likely to agree to this? Second, I am saving £800 a month, of which £200 is going into a help-to-buy Isa. Where should I put the remaining £600 per month?
I would appreciate your advice. BH
A Most lenders will be perfectly happy to give you a mortgage with a shorter term than the typical 25 years and may well insist on it if a more conventional mortgage term would end up with you still repaying it well into retirement. So the fact that you want to have cleared your mortgage by the time you retire will be music to a lender’s ears.
As to what to do with your monthly savings, one option might have been to transfer the money in your help-to-buy Isa into the newer lifetime Isa. You get the same 25% government bonus as with the help-to-buy Isa but you can pay in up to £4,000 a year rather than £2,400 (£3,400 in the first year) which works out at just over £330 a month with a maximum government bonus of £1,000 on top. However, the fact that, on your current rate of saving, you will have saved up £25,000 in just over two and a half years (when you will be 48 or 49) suggests that you are not currently aged between 18 and 39 and so are not eligible to take out a lifetime Isa.
Your age doesn’t stop you taking out a standard cash Isa but the Isa rules do. You can’t pay into a help-to-buy Isa and a normal cash Isa at the same time. So, as a cash Isa isn’t an option, you are left with finding a savings account paying a decent amount of interest. If you can commit to regular savings, Leeds building society’s Regular Saver (issue 12) account pays 2.55% but the most you can pay in each month is £250. You can pay up to £500 a month into the Regular Savings (issue 3) account from Kent Reliance which pays 3% in interest but the only way to open the account is at a branch.
For the remainder of your £600, probably the best option is an internet account from either Post Office Money or Tesco Bank, both of which pay 1.3%.
It would also be worth checking that the interest rate on your help-to-buy Isa is as good as the nationally available help-to-buy Isa from Barclays which pays 2.5%. If it’s not, transferring to the Barclays offering – which you should be free to do – would be a good idea.
