The Orphanage has found its place as one of the great chillers of the 21st century, capable of intermixing truly unsettling scares and a deeper vein of emotion.
Its writer Sergio G. Sánchez, who also penned 2010’s The Impossible, now makes his directorial debut with The Secret of Marrowbone, having also crafted the film’s screenplay.
Set in 1969, the film opens with a British woman named Rose (Nicola Harrison) moving to rural America with her four children to live in Marrowbone House, where she grew up; telling them to take on the name of the house, to forget their pasts and to start anew.
When the children are left to fend for themselves, they must live by their mother’s promise to keep the secret of her death until the eldest, Jack (George MacKay), is old enough to legally care for his siblings.
However, they must all deal with the creeping realisation that there is a visitor amongst them. One from another plane of existence.
MacKay stars alongside The VVitch‘s Anya Taylor-Joy, Stranger Things‘ Charlie Heaton, and A Cure for Wellness‘ Mia Goth.
The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, with a release in Sánchez’s native Spain in October of last year.
