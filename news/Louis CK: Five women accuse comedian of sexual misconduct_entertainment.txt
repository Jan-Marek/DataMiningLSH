Comedian women have told The New York Times comic and filmmaker Louis CK allegedly masturbated in front of them.
The claim is one of several which involve CK (real name Louis Székely) either masturbating in a woman's presence or expressing an interest in doing so.
Comedy duo Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov said that, in 2002, CK allegedly invited them to his hotel room in Aspen, Colorado after a show to hang out.
While the pair were still fully clothed, CK allegedly took out his penis before proceeding to take all of his clothes off, "get completely naked, and start masturbating".
Abby Schachner and Rebecca Corry also revealed their experiences, the latter claiming CK "asked if we could go to my dressing room so he could masturbate in front of me."
Courteney Cox, one of the show's executive producers, said to NYT in an email: "What happened to Rebecca on that set was awful," adding that she felt "outrage and shock."
His publicist, Lewis Kay, told the paper that the comedian would not respond, writing in an email: “Louis is not going to answer any questions."
The New York premiere of the comedian's new film, I Love You, Daddy was cancelled Thursday morning ahead of the publishing of The New York Times story.
The Independent has contacted CK's rep for comment.
