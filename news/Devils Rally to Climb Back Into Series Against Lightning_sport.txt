NEWARK — Taylor Hall had a goal and two assists as the Devils rallied for a 5-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals in Newark.
Hall’s big night ensured the Devils will get a chance to even the series in Game 4 at home on Wednesday.
Hall scored his second goal of the series and then made nifty passes to set up goals by Will Butcher and Stefan Noesen in the third period. Hall’s pass to Butcher during a five-on-three tied the game at just over 4 minutes into the third, and his feed to Noesen gave the Devils a one-goal lead with 7 minutes and 5 seconds remaining.
Hall became the first Devil to have a three-point postseason game since Zach Parise in 2012 against the Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals.
