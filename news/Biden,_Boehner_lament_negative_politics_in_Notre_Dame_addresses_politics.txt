(CNN) Vice President Joe Biden and former House Speaker John Boehner shared the stage at Notre Dame University's commencement ceremony Sunday where they both spoke on the current negative state of politics.
Biden and Boehner, who are both Catholics, were each awarded the 2016 Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious honor at the catholic university.
Biden joked that while he didn't like Boehner -- the two were often on opposite sides over issues like Obamacare and government spending -- he "loved him."
Boehner, for his part, said it was an honor to share the stage with the vice president.
Notre Dame's President Rev. John I. Jenkins, said the university chose to give the prestigious award to the two politicians from different sides as a comment on the current political environment "where poisonous invective and partisan gamesmanship pass for political leadership."
