The FBI is reportedly investigating an alleged “sex-tape extortion plot” against actor and comedian Kevin Hart.
Over the weekend, Hart issued a public apology via Instagram to his wife Eniko Parrish, who is pregnant, and children over an “error in judgement” that he said resulted in an alleged extortion attempt.
While Hart did not go into details, TMZ reports that a person has threatened him with a video which allegedly shows him in a “sexually provocative” position with a woman who is not his wife.
“I'm at a place in my life where I feel like I have a target on my back and because of that I should make smart decisions. And recently I didn't,” he said in the Instagram video.
“But I'm not going to allow a person to have financial gain off my mistakes and in this particular situation that's what was attempted. I said I'd rather 'fess up to my mistakes.”
Sending so many apologies to my wife & kids. I gotta do better and I will. I'm not perfect and have never claimed to be ...I love you all. A post shared by Kevin Hart (@kevinhart4real) on Sep 16, 2017 at 4:07pm PDT
According to TMZ, the unidentified woman in the video has allegedly threatened to leak the tape if Hart does not pay her a “multi-million dollar sum”.
The publication reports that the FBI is currently investigating the situation.
A spokesperson told E! News: “We cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.”
A representative for Hart later released a statement for clarification: “Someone tried to set Kevin up in a failed extortion attempt.
“As law enforcement is involved, we cannot comment further as it could affect the investigation.”
