And we do. iPhones, iPads, computers, eyeglasses (sun, bifocals, trifocals), jackets, scarves, gloves, belts, shoes. All manner of identity — green cards, passports, birth certificates. A variety of Very Important Documents. So many wedding rings! The number of people trying to get unmarried by tossing their wedding rings into the trays rolling through security screening may, or may not, surprise you.
The JFK Airport Lost & Found listings are reliquary in nature, its objects imbued with sacredness by the seekers. It is a purgatory of desire and the lack implicit in desire.
You can read these appeals until you become one of the lost items in need of finding. Eventually we will lose our hair, our teeth, our memory, our dignity, our way, our very lives, but these 300 some pages of items important enough for people to want back is a testament to the search. What are we really searching for? This is the shadow that haunts this museum and its exhibit of loss, yearning and love.
NO WORKERS, NO BAGS
AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD
GETTING NO HELP.
Hello, After sitting on the runway for 4 hours and then waiting in Baggage claim aisle, only to see no bags come for hours and hours, I had to return to care for a family member and leave my luggage behind. Please find my luggage and mail to my house. Last nights disaster at Terminal One was inexcusable. There were no workers, no bags and hundreds of people from around the world getting no help. Please help!
BEFORE HE RETURNS FROM THE HOLIDAYS
(OH MY GOODNESS)
Oh my goodness my boyfriend is going to be so upset with me if I don’t track this down. I left his Nintendo switch on a China southern flight into JFK. I was in row 48, I believe in seat A, at the window. I have not broken it to him that I left it behind and I’m hoping that it can be returned to me before he returns from the holidays with his family. I appreciate any and all help.
