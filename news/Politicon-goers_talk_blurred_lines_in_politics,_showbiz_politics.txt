Story highlights Politicon, an annual two-day event, takes place in Pasadena, California
About 10,000 people attended this year's Politicon
Los Angeles (CNN) Politics and entertainment have always overlapped. But at Politicon, a two-day conference held in Pasadena, California, they become one.
The event, which drew in about 10,000 people in its third year, has been deemed by some as "the Comic-Con for politics" or "Coachella of politics" because of its ability to put politicians, pundits, entertainers, activists, media personalities and political junkies all in one place at one time.
Politicon creator Simon Sidi, a British-born rock-show producer, said he created the conference in 2015 with the intent of bringing together the two worlds of entertainment and politics.
"Politicon is a nerd fest," he told CNN. "We're here to entertain people who love the world of politics."
Much has changed since the first Politicon. Donald Trump -- a former reality TV star -- is President; Hollywood's thirst for politically inspired shows and movies has only grown; and the media is now filled with a frenzy of politics stories on a daily basis, including speculation on celebrities' political aspirations: This year alone two big entertainers -- actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and musician Kid Rock -- have expressed interest in running for political office. Some say they feel the line between entertainment and politics has become even more blurred.
