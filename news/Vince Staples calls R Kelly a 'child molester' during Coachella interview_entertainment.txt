Vince Staples slammed R. Kelly calling him a "child molester" and a "piece of f****** s***" during an interview at Coachella this weekend.
After his set, the rapper sat down with Nadeska Alexis of Everyday Struggle where their conversation about the disgraced R&B singer was livestreamed.
Staples mocked the interview and read from Alexis' teleprompter revealing he wouldn't be sticking to typical PR points.
"I've got one more year on probation. When my last year of probation is over, I'm breaking speed limits—I'm doing wild shit," Staples said.
When Alexis then suggested he should play it safe to avoid going to prison, the rapper pivoted the conversation unprompted to R.Kelly saying, "If piece of f****** s***" R. Kelly didn't go to jail for being a child molester and peeing on people and having a human trafficking ring in Atlanta, then I'll be alright."
During their interview, Alexis pushed back on Staples' responses and said that their talk would "get her fired."
But Staples continued, "Because R. Kelly a piece of s***? He don't work here. They should have booked R. Kelly if they like R. Kelly so much. He would have p***** on somebody in the crowd. Because he pees on people."
On Monday he tweeted a response to the conversation around his Coachella interview saying, "While everybody overreacting to my pretty logical take on Robert Kelly I'm gonnna leave you an image of black excellence. Repost for 65 years of good luck."
