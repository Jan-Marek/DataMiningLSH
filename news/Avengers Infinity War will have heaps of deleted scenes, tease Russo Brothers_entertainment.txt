With less than two weeks until Avengers: Infinity War crashes in cinemas, fans are seeking out as much information about the third Avengers movie as available, hoping to discover clues about Thanos’s plan to wipe out half of Earth’s existence.
The movie will feature almost every Marvel superhero we’ve seen on screen thus far. And considering how many characters are being squeezed into the team-up, we expect a fairly large number of usable scenes that were shot to be deleted from the final cut.
However, The Russo Brothers are known to be particularly frugal with what they shoot, often not leaving much out of the final movie (hence why there are so few Winter Soldier and Civil War deleted scenes).
Speaking to Digital Spy, the directors said Infinity war will be different. “We were very tight with the scripts on Winter Soldier and Civil War, so there weren't a lot of extras,” Joe Russo told the publication.
“This is a very big movie with a lot of characters in it, and we played around with a lot of improvisation, because we had new chemistry that we were defining between characters.
Theatrical trailer for Avengers: Infinity War
“It was the first time ever that all these characters were on screen together, so we played around with quite a bit of footage, and I think there will be some good stuff for the DVD.”
Infinity War, which marks the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movies, has already set records — the first full trailer quickly became the most-watched trailer within 24 hours ever.
American ticket sellers Fandango say the Russo Brothers-directed movie has already sold more presale tickets than the last seven Marvel movies combined – that includes Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
