Between the ages of 18 and 65, the British population undergoes an astonishing metamorphosis.

By the time they’re 65 they’re necking toasted teacakes on the Dorset coast. What happens in between? Suburbia.

The age-old cliche of “God’s Waiting Rooms” is a cliche because it’s true. And although there is some evidence of groovier baby boomers moving back to cities, generally we retire to Britain’s southern, south-western and East Anglian coasts (a few opt for prettier countryside – Cumbria, the Yorkshire Dales, or gentler swathes in the Midlands). Christchurch in Dorset is cited as the spot with most retirees, 31% of the town in 2016. These days it’s been overtaken by the North Norfolk Coast (32%), the East Sussex countryside behind Hastings (32%) and the West Somerset Coast (33%). We want the warm, sunny, untroubling (and expensive) sort of seaside.
Britain is ageing. When I reach 65 in 2036, 24% of the UK will be my age or older, up from 14% when I was born. The ONS predicts we’ll follow our parents to Burnham Market, Budleigh Salterton and Christchurch. Whether my generation will be able to afford to is a moot point. I rather have my eye on Berlin.
